<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
   Consider pop punk defended. Man Overboard, the four-piece outfit out of New Jersey, have made a statement with their debut full length Real Talk that is much harder, faster, and louder than a catchy, often-quoted band mantra. While the band's previous material has been extremely enjoyable, climbing to the most coveted parts of my iTunes play counts, their latest offering is their first real spoonful of pop punk. Dual vocalists Zac Eiestenstein and Nik Bruzzese are more aggressive on Real Talk, and their vocals are paced by dirtier-sounding guitars, contributing to a more punk-influenced style. As an overwhelming initial wave of support shows, I'm in the same boat of thinking as most Man Overboard fans when I welcome the new style. It's the exact direction I was hoping this band would take, and the direction that they needed to take to back up their mantra. It's safe to say that Man Overboard have not only defended the genre, but have exceeded all expectations in the process.<br><br>Although Real Talk isn't set to be released until July 20, a leak of the album has led the group to distribute digital downloads to everyone who preordered the record. And although summer officially started on June 21, it was the June 22 early release date of this album that really kicked things off. Now, calling an album a 'summer album' is an insult in the minds of some users. But when I say this, I don't mean it as a throwaway term for mediocre pop punk. Real Talk is a lighthearted, fun record that happens to be perfect for the hot weather. Yes, most of the songs are about girls. Yes, this sound has been done a thousand times before. But who really cares? Real Talk is the pop punk album of the summer, and is only behind Enemy of the World and The Upsides in the genre this year.<br><br>From the opening drumstick taps on 'Real Talk', Man Overboard show you their new sound in full force. Older fans of the band might be surprised at first, as I was, but the rougher style immediately settles in and feels natural. As is the case with most of the album, 'Real Talk' flows directly into 'World Favorite', a number with the kind of lyrics that you doodle on your notebook in English class. First single 'Fantasy Girl' showcases a enormous, glossy hook and is paced by the soaring trade-offs between Eiestenstein and Bruzzese in the chorus.<br><br>One thing Real Talk benefits enormously from is the sequencing of the tracks. 'Parting Gift' follows up the first single, and proves to be one of the most essential songs on the album. While the hook and chorus are good, the bridge/outro is something that you can put on repeat over and over again without ever growing weary. 'I wrote you down a letter before I went to sleep / It had all the secrets I could no longer keep / I held them in for so long I was going to break / But maybe now I can rest and you can lie awake.' While those lyrics aren't exactly superbly deep, they're delivered in an excellent fashion by the dual vocalists and as the music builds up with each repeat of the line, it only gets more fun to sing it back.<br><br>The double-take of the poppy 'She's Got Her Own Man Now' and the synth-laden, Motion City Soundtrack-esque 'Al Sharpton' gets the listener ready for the strongest track on Real Talk, 'Montrose'. More upbeat and energetic than the previously released version of the song, the album version of 'Montrose' is highlighted by fantastic micro-breakdowns, a stellar chorus, and a perfectly executed instrumental bridge. Man Overboard aren't afraid to flex their instruments on Real Talk, and the result is a record completely filled with quality riffage, rock solid drumming , and pulsing bass lines. Rounding out the album, 'Septemberism' is a last taste of the aggressive nature of Man Overboard, as closer 'Sidekick' is a pure pop gem that will undoubtedly please those who still play 'Love Your Friends, Die Laughing' twelve times a day.<br><br>Man Overboard have made themselves one of the most important and exciting upcoming pop punk acts in the scene today. After several quality EP releases, Real Talk marks their first 'official' album, and they have absolutely blown me out of the water with it. Quickly rising to the cream of the crop in the genre, Man Overboard are hitting their stride right from the get-go and should not be ignored. Adding another breath of fresh air to this turn-of-the-decade pop punk rejuvenation, I think Man Overboard have a legitimate shot at becoming the next huge crossover phenomenon from our scene.<br><br>If you have yet to hear the record, be sure to preorder it now from Run for Cover to get the early download.<br><br> <br>
