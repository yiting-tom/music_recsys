<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> The Holy Night</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>Lyricist：Sarantos<br>Composer：Sarantos<br><br>The Holy Night<br>By Selma Lagerlof<br><br>There was a man who went out in the dark night to borrow live coals to<br>kindle a fire. He went from hut to hut and knocked. 'Dear friends, help<br>me!' said he. 'My wife has just given birth to a child, and I must make a<br>fire to warm her and the little one.'<br><br>But it was way in the night, and all the people were asleep. No one replied.<br><br>The man walked and walked. At last he saw the gleam of a fire a long way<br>off. Then, he went in that direction and saw that the fire was burning in<br>the open. A lot of sheep were were sleeping around the fire, and an old<br>shepherd sat and watched over the flock.<br><br>When the man who wanted to borrow fire came up to the sheep, he saw<br>that three big dogs lay asleep at the shepherd's feet. All three awoke when<br>the man approached and opened their great jaws, as though they wanted<br>to bark; but not a sound was heard. The man noticed that the hair on their<br>backs stood up and that their sharp, white teeth glistened in the firelight.<br>They dashed toward him.<br><br>He felt that one of them bit at his leg and one at this hand and that one<br>clung to this throat. But their jaws and teeth wouldn't obey them, and the<br>man didn't suffer the least harm.<br><br>Now the man wished to go farther, to get what he needed. But the sheep<br>lay back to back and so close to one another that he couldn't pass them.<br>Then, the man stepped upon their backs and walked over them and up to<br>the fire. And not one of the animals awoke or moved.<br><br>When the man had almost reached the fire, the shepherd looked up. He<br>was a surly old man, who was unfriendly and harsh toward human beings.<br>And when he saw the strange man coming, he seized the long spiked staff,<br>which he always held in his hand when he tended his flock, and threw it at<br>him. The staff came right toward the man, but, before it reached him, it<br>turned off to one side and whizzed past him, far out in the meadow.<br><br>Now the man came up to the shepherd and said to him: 'Good man, help<br>me, and lend me a little fire! My wife has just given birth to a child, and I<br>must make a fire to warm her and the little one.'<br><br>The shepherd would rather have said no, but when he pondered that the<br>dogs couldn't hurt the man, and the sheep had not run from him, and that<br>the staff had not wished to strike him, he was a little afraid and dared not<br>deny the man that which he asked.<br><br>'Take as much as you need!' he said to the man.<br><br>But then the fire was nearly burnt out. There were no logs or branches left,<br>only a big heap of live coals, and the stranger had neither spade nor shovel<br>wherein he could carry the red-hot coals.<br><br>When the shepherd saw this, he said again: 'Take as much as you need!'<br>And he was glad that the man wouldn't be able to take away any coals.<br><br>But the man stopped and picked coals from the ashes with his bare hands,<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>and laid them in his mantle. And he didn't burn his hands when he<br>touched them, nor did the coals scorch his mantle; but he carried them<br>away as if they had been nuts or apples.<br><br>And when the shepherd, who was such a cruel and hardhearted man, saw<br>all this, he began to wonder to himself. What kind of a night is this, when<br>the dogs do not bite, the sheep are not scared, the staff does not kill, or the<br>fire scorch? He called the stranger back and said to him: 'What kind of a<br>night is this? And how does it happen that all things show you<br>compassion?'<br><br>Then said the man: 'I cannot tell you if you yourself do not see it.' And he<br>wished to go his way, that he might soon make a fire and warm his wife<br>and child.<br><br>But the shepherd did not wish to lose sight of the man before he had found<br>out what all this might portend. He got up and followed the man till they<br>came to the place where he lived.<br><br>Then the shepherd saw the man didn't have so much as a hut to dwell in,<br>but that his wife and babe were lying in a mountain grotto, where there<br>was nothing except the cold and naked stone walls.<br><br>But the shepherd thought that perhaps the poor innocent child might<br>freeze to death there in the grotto; and, although he was a hard man, he<br>was touched, and thought he would like to help it. And he loosened the<br>knapsack from his shoulder, took from it a soft white sheepskin, gave it to<br>the strange man, and said that he should let the child sleep on it.<br><br>But just as soon as he showed that he, too, could be merciful, his eyes were<br>opened, and he saw what he had not been able to see before, and heard<br>what he could not have heard before.<br><br>He saw that all around him stood a ring of little silver-winged angels, and<br>each held a stringed instrument, and all sang in loud tones that tonight<br>the Saviour was born who should redeem the world from its sins.<br><br>Then he understood how all things were so happy this night and they<br>didn't want to do anything wrong.<br><br>And it was not only around the shepherd that there were angels, but he<br>saw them everywhere. They sat inside the grotto, they sat outside on the<br>mountain, and they flew under the heavens. They came marching in great<br>companies, and, as they passed, they paused and cast a glance at the child.<br><br>There was such jubilation and such gladness and songs and play! And all<br>this he saw in the dark night whereas before he could not have made out<br>anything. He was so happy because his eyes had been opened that he fell<br>upon his knees and thanked God.<br><br>What that shepherd saw, we might also see, for the angels fly down from<br>heaven every Christmas Eve, if we could only see them.<br><br>You must remember this, for it is as true, as true as that I see you and you<br>see me. It is not revealed by the light of lamps or candles, and it does not<br>depend upon sun and moon; but that which is needful is that we have such<br>eyes as can see God's glory.<br><br>
