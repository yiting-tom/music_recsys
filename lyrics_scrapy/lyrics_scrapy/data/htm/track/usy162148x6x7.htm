It's fucked, uh<br>How did I get disrespectful?<br>How can I drive past the house ten times in a day, and not once go in and check you?<br>Not ask once if your day's been stressful<br>You need your son there in a cape to rescue<br>It's fucked, I don't have the time to text you but I got time for the girls online that's sexual<br>And I know them bills are piling up<br>And you won't admit it but I'm letting you down<br>And I remember when I got my car I said 'you won't ever have to put your foot on the ground'<br>I know you got the lines in your fingers<br>Cuz you went and bought bare shit that's weighing a bag down<br>I should at least call a car or cab round, it hurts now I can hear the bus in the background<br>I'm slacking as a son and I know this<br>I ain't doing half of the shit I'm supposed to<br>I got a little brother that I never check<br>I'm meant to go through all the shit that you go through<br>And you are meant to be my queen<br>And I'm out here treating you like a jester<br>Bringing you gifts not only in December<br>But honestly birthdays I can barely remember<br><br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>And when it comes to money<br>I'm fucked, yeah trust me I know<br>See I hate asking her for money but when I do, iight cool look<br>This is how it normally goes<br>'Yo mummy, I need some money', she'll say cool and go to the cashpoint on the road<br>And take that money that she don't really have<br>But she loves me way too much to say no<br>You see I almost cried when I wrote this<br>Because I picture my mum walking through the door with a fake smile giving me the cash<br>True say, she loves me way too much to say no<br>Now I know my need ain't greater<br>But now I can't say no or another<br>Cuz she says being able to provide for her son is what makes her feel like a mother<br>And she won't take the money back<br>So how the fuck am I meant to feel?<br>Cuz now I got money for bullshit<br>And that means she might have to go skip a meal<br>And, when I comes to my little brother Dylan I'm slipping<br>See I never make time with him<br>But the truth is that boy means everything to me see that boy is my rhythm<br>The simple shit<br>Yeah my mum would say 'go tell him off cuz he ain't done all the dishes'<br>But I'm thinking like if I ain't been around then why the fuck would he listen? Shit<br>Look, I've become that stereotypical, that big bro that will buy you all the trainers but won't sit and call<br>So niggerish for blacks that typical issue, you know<br>I'll buy you football boots but never find time to kick the ball with you, uh<br>So now I gotta switch up<br>I gotta care a little less about getting my dick sucked<br>Make sure the next time mum's phone rings she ain't gotta ring twice, I'm there before she picks up<br>Music, look you have to work<br>And if you don't, then I don't know<br>Because I'm man enough to tell you now that I don't really wanna go back to the road<br>You see, them niggas rap for a new chain<br>Don't get it twisted, I wear one but that shit will come after all the bills are paid<br>And I can say 'yo, go get your hair done'<br>Everyone talks about stereotypes<br>But no one admits to the stereotypes<br>So fuck it, I'll put my hands up<br>Look on some real shit<br>I be the stereotype, had a wife that was good for me, that I never shoulda let go<br>I be the stereotype, that nigga with a nice car, driving it to his mum's house<br>I be the stereotype, I got an ex named Taneesha and Felicia, real shit<br>I be the stereotype, see my credit's so shit I can only get cash cards nigga<br>I be the stereotype, that pay taxes but too embarrassed to sign on yeah<br>I be the stereotype, that spends my last Ps on clothes, look good but broke<br>I be the stereotype, probably in a girl's friendzone right now just waiting to fuck<br>That stereotype, I tell my young Gs stay out of trouble and then catch a case<br>That stereotype, and I pray my daughter's never a hoe, but yeah I love jezzies<br>That stereotype, and I feel embarrassed when I'm around Muslims that are on Deen<br>That stereotype, and the worst one is, never see a man get stabbed on the ends on that war and shit<br>And the feds ask me to help out and bring justice, me, I say I never saw that shit<br>But if my house got burgled, or a white man shot my nan in public<br>And the feds never help me out, I be the first one screaming 'Where's the justice?'<br>I am that typical nigga<br>Yeah I am tryna put the good stereotype<br>Yeah I am that nigga with a bop in his step<br>Yeah I am C-CADET CADET<br>I know who I am<br>That stereotype<br>That stereotype<br><br>
