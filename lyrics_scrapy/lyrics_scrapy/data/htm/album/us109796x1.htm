<br>
<br>
   Blackfield's third album, Welcome to my DNA, is to be released in March, followed by live dates in the UK and Europe in April, and in the US in May. <br><br>Blackfield is the acclaimed collaboration between Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree) and Israeli artist Aviv Geffen. The duo are currently putting the finishing touches on their third album, which is due to be released in March on Kscope. Formed after a meeting in 2000, the partnership blossomed into a cross-cultural collaboration that has already spawned two albums (2004‚– Blackfield and 2007's Blackfield II).<br><br>They will be playing Leamington Assembly (6th), Manchester Academy 2 (7th) and London Shepherd's Bush Empire (8th) along with a date at Amsterdam's Paradiso on the 10th followed by a series of gigs in Europe (full dates on the live page). Further dates including a US tour will be announced soon.<br><br>These will be the first dates they have played together as Blackfield for over three years, due to both artists' recent hectic schedules.<br><br>Porcupine Tree's 2009 release, The Incident, is the band's best selling album to date, and the band has continued to raise its profile around the world, recently playing sold out gigs at London's Royal Albert Hall and New York's Radio City Music Hall. However, Porcupine Tree is just one of Steven's several musical projects, which also include Blackfield, No-Man, and Bass Communion. Steven is also a Grammy nominated producer and mixer working with the likes of Opeth, King Crimson, and Yoko Ono. He also co-wrote and sang a song on the recent UK number one album by Pendulum.<br><br>In 2009, Aviv released his first English language solo album (produced by Trevor Horn) and has supported U2 and Placebo. The son of esteemed Israeli poet Yehonatan Geffen and the nephew of Moshe Dayan, Geffen is Israel's leading counter–culture rock musician. A huge star in his native country, his records have been greeted with critical adulation, earning him a string of gold albums. An outspoken peace campaigner, he controversially refused to do compulsory military service, and his lyrics have been fiercely critical of the Israeli military and their actions.<br><br>Aviv has worked with various artists, including Brett Anderson (Suede), Mercury Rev and Belle and Sebastian, throughout his career but it has been his partnership with Steven that has proved the most fertile, and both artists have been keen to return to their work with Blackfield.<br><br> <br>
