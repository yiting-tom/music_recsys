<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> Twentytwofourteen</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>We were best friends, destined to learn each others lessons<br>You called with a question and I ignored your message<br>Tension sets in and I can say that since then<br>At 10:14 PM I finally regret this.<br><br>Cried for your attention.<br>Blew out your birthday candles.<br>Threw my toys when I was mad.<br>The worst way to handle it.<br><br>When you told me the dog died.<br>But I let him out without a leash<br>And didn't tell you to avoid being hogtied and beat with reeds.<br><br>I told you the wrong lies.<br>Said the truth too often.<br>Though the other boys were good<br>I never threw caution.<br><br>I locked you out of your bedroom.<br>And hid the key under the door.<br>Thought I was smartest guy,<br>And never really wanted more.<br><br>I drew disfigured pictures of you<br>In odd and screwed up ways.<br>With the same blue markers on the wall<br>Where I drew my name.<br><br>Cheated in board games.<br>Never liked to play fair.<br>Made fun of you at daycare.<br>And told you I can't Share.<br><br>I forgot to get a gift.<br>Never called on Christmas.<br>Made jokes at funerals.<br>Never sweated the little shit.<br><br>Tore pages out of your journal.<br>By the way, I unlocked your journal.<br>Now there's a bit of an awkward turtle.<br>Disobeyed the doctors orders.<br><br>I punched holes in your walls.<br>Shattered your painted windows.<br>Hid in the shower for several hours<br>Till you made the amends grow.<br><br>I walked all over you.<br>Told you that you weren't pretty.<br>Of course, I'll be damned if I ordered you<br>To stand where you were sitting.<br><br>I peer pressured you,<br>Even though I wasn't your peer.<br>Pulled down your curtains<br>So respect would disappear.<br><br>Said I was going one way<br>But then I'd go another.<br>Turned my back on you when you<br>Acted like my own mother.<br><br>Promised I'd quit smoking.<br>You asked me to quit joking.<br>Told you you were adopted<br>You cried, and told me to stop it.<br><br>I made your computer crash.<br>Deleted your photographs.<br>Scratched all your records<br>Never paid you back for the load of cash.<br><br>I took off without you.<br>Constantly pushed you away.<br>Kept secrets to myself,<br>But then I'd ask you to stay<br><br>I put As on the back of your shirt<br>So you can see where it actually hurts.<br>Blamed you for attacking me first.<br>Told you that you're asking for worse<br><br>Things to come.<br>I bleed your blood<br>I need your love.<br>I keyed your truck.<br><br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>Wasn't afraid to fight back.<br>Never got on the right track.<br>Turned your eyes black<br>When I gave you a hard slap.<br><br>I dragged your ass on the carpet<br>And gave you bad rug-burn.<br>Showed the skies would darken when I<br>Said I don't love her.<br><br>We were best friends, destined to learn each others lessons.<br>You called with a question and I ignored your message<br>Tension sets in and I can say that since then<br>At 10:14 PM I finally regret this.<br><br>I decided to steal your money.<br>Gamble it all away for good.<br>Then I had you bail me out.<br>Just because I knew that you could.<br><br>Vandalized your village.<br>Tantalized you and pillaged.<br>Slowly ripped out your wallpaper.<br>And Turned the water to spillage.<br><br>Smashed your mirrors in.<br>Then I Crashed your American<br>Car, that I borrowed without asking<br>For your parenting.<br><br>Cut off your hair while you slept<br>Slashed your clothes into nets.<br>Sold your house and your belongings<br>Till you had nothing left.<br><br>Everything was your fault.<br>Cause I didn't carry a heart.<br>Then you took the blame<br>I didn't know where to start.<br><br>Constantly called you stupid.<br>Even though you were always smart.<br>Stopped calling you by your name.<br>We were only falling apart.<br><br>I ignored you on one condition.<br>To further my own position.<br>Avoided eye contact to put<br>You in a cold submission.<br><br>I tripped you until you fell.<br>Bruised your arms and legs.<br>Held you down and tied you up<br>And made you fall again.<br><br>I cut off your air supply<br>Kept you underwater.<br>Held you back, and weighed you down<br>So now the space is larger<br><br>I spit in your face and called you a whore.<br>Chose to hang out with a girl<br>Instead of you, so I guess you have the right to say that now it's war.<br><br>Tortured you with a lighter.<br>Pushed you off the roof<br>I stabbed you with a box-cutter.<br>Buried you with the truth.<br><br>Pretended it never happened.<br>Wiped my hands clean.<br>Gave it the cold shoulder<br>Cause I don't owe a damn thing.<br><br>Stuck to my resolutions.<br>Smiled everyday.<br>Read the paper in the morning<br>Survived in many ways.<br><br>Stole your identity,<br>And achieved serenity.<br>I left the rest of me<br>Deep inside your memory.<br>Started a new life,<br>And forgot what you meant to me.<br><br>Chorus<br><br>
