<br>
   No art comes unencumbered without being grounded in some sort of tradition. The challenge is to take conventions that have often become cliche and charge them with a transformative quality. In this vein, Chambers Old Love rams hardcore and 70s-inspired rock'n roll headfirst into each other with impressive results, taking two genres that have quite extensively been explored and, much like Outcry Collective, fusing them together to inject the rock with new life, or the hardcore with more flair depending on how you want to look at it.<br><br>The record is a raucous affair, a dirty, sweat-drenched violent collision. It's like Thin Lizzy's best impulses played by American Nightmare, and to top that off, vocalist Dan Pelic is the best that Wes Eisold has sounded since Background Music. It was no surprise to learn that these guys were basically discovered by Gallows at a packed basement show in New Jersey; that statement about encapsulates the atmosphere of this record. See if you aren't red in the face after screaming along to some of these bad boys.<br><br>For the most part the band sticks pretty closely to the model of whiskey rock-cum-late 20th century Boston hardcore, which is a wildly successful formula. The raw energy is what initially made me fall in love with hardcore all those years ago, and it is here in spades. This is the very sound of reckless abandon committed to tape that packed basements with people flinging themselves on top of each other and at the mic for a chance to join in on the all-important gang vocals. And yet, underneath that blistering line-drive is a finely tuned rock'n roll machine; their little side-roads into southern rock territory don't hurt, with the Maylene and the Sons of Disaster-esque 「Crap Out」 being one of the album's highlights.<br><br>In this Pro Tools-saturated universe it's comforting to know someone's still down to just kick out the jams as if MySpace didn't exist. As hardcore opens its fifth decade of existence one might be tempted to ask just how much more can be accomplished before the genre completely chugs itself to death. I can confidently say we'll be floor-punching well into the millennium as long as bands keep putting out records that drip with this much passion. Old Love is as sincere as it gets. Will someone get these guys a damn record contract already? <br><br> <br>
