<br>
<br>
High praise is something Transfer have gathered in bucket loads, however. Since first recording Future Selves in 2009, the four piece - Jason Cardenas (guitar, vocals) and Matthew Molarius (vocals, guitar), Shaun Cornell (bass) and Andy Ridley (drums) - soon picked up high profile support slots with White Lies, The Bravery and Killers front man, Brandon Flowers.<br><br>Along the way they amassed a growing, but near hysterical fanbase in Europe, where early arrivals for Flowers shows quickly tuned into Transfer's sound. Facebook and Twitter later buzzed with good vibes; the band s reputation went beyond the moshpit: in 2010, Cool Green<br>Recordings signed them to their label and made plans to release Future Selves in 2011.<br><br>While headlining several shows across Europe throughout the summer, Transfer s arrival has actually been a long time coming. The nuts and<br>bolts of the band are located in the friendship of Molarius and Cardenas, who first met at school. The pair began recording together eight<br>years ago and moved to San Diego in 2003 where they worked with a merry-go-round of supporting musicians. Eventually a creative tryst<br>was formed in 2008 with bassist, Cornell and drummer, Ridley.<br><br>Acoustic sketches and song ideas were soon fleshed out. In sessions, the four took their cues from what Cardenas describes as the 'five basic food groups' of rock n roll: The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and The Stones. Further inspiration was drawn from My Morning Jacket, The Flaming Lips and Arcade Fire. Noise-some melodies were laid down and an album s worth of demos began to take shape.<br>Meanwhile, Cornell's arrival provided added inspirational, not just in Transfer s melodic engine room, but via his recording expertise. Having<br>worked as a local producer with his own studio space, Cornell's facilities and production savvy meant the band could experiment at leisure.<br>Later, as Transfer added extra muscle to the songs that would make up Future Selves, tracks were self-produced/mixed with Cornell<br>and Mark Needham (The Killers, Fleetwood Mac) at the controls.<br><br>The fruits of this creative hub are now being converted into large-scale praise. In America, the band are tipped for Big Things. Europe is catching on as well. Headline gigs across the continent this summer and Transfer's re-released debut seem set to further their growing<br>reputation.
