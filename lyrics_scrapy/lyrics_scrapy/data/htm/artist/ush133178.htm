<dd class="hb9">Helen Reddy( Helen Maxine Reddy )【 10 albums 74 lyrics 】</dd>
<dd class="hb0">Helen Maxine Reddy (born 25 October 1941) is an Australian singer, actor and activist. Born in Melbourne to a show-business family, Reddy started her career as an entertainer at age four. She sang on radio and television, and won a talent contest on a television programme Bandstand[a] in 1966 for a ticket prize to New York City and an unsuccessful record audition. She pursued her international singing career by moving to Chicago and, subsequently, Los Angeles, where she made her debut singles 'One Way Ticket' and 'I Believe in Music' in 1968 and 1970, respectively. The B-side of the latter single, 'I Don't Know How to Love Him' reached No. 13 in Canadian pop chart RPM and she was signed to Capitol Records a year later.<br><br>During the 1970s, she enjoyed international success, especially in the United States where she placed 15 singles in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. Six made the Top 10 and three reached No. 1, including her signature hit 'I Am Woman'. She placed 25 songs on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart; 15 made the Top 10 and eight reached No. 1, six consecutively. In 1974, at the inaugural American Music Awards, she became the first artist to win the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist. In television, she was the first Australian to host her own one-hour weekly primetime variety show on an American network, along with several specials that were seen in more than 40 countries.<br><br>Between the 1980s and 1990s, as her single 'I Can't Say Goodbye to You' became her last to chart in the U.S., she acted in musical theatres and recorded a few albums such as Center Stage before retiring from live performance in 2002. She returned to university in Australia and earned her degree, and practised as a clinical hypnotherapist and motivational speaker. In 2011, after singing 'Breezin' Along with the Breeze' with her half-sister, Toni Lamond, for Lamond's birthday, Reddy decided to return to live performing.<br><br>Her song 'I Am Woman' played a large role in popular culture and became an anthem for second-wave feminism. She came to be known as a 'feminist poster girl' or a 'feminist icon'. In 2011, Billboard named her the No. 28 adult contemporary artist of all time (No. 9 woman). In 2013 the Chicago Tribune dubbed her as the 'Queen of '70s Pop'. </dd>
