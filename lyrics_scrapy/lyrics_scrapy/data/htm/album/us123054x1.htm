<br>
<br>
Though often compared to fellow Pittsburgh rockers Anti-Flag, The Code is blazing their own path of positive politically and socially conscience messages with the upcoming release of their new EP on Jump Start Records. The Code is ready to send their newest musical triumphs out into the world and let me say there are no complaints from the peanut gallery! The new EP contains three unreleased songs as well as a cover of the Operation Ivy song 'Unity', a nod to the band they have so often be compared to in their CD reviews. Keeping true to their punk/ska roots, the new release successfully supports and strengthens their bluecollar agenda of raising heads in questioning authority. Their melodies and tunes, tougher then the blue collar industries they grew up around, are sure to serve as inspiration to the fans and bands already under their influence. Produced, mixed, and mastered by a cast of veritable rock and roll all stars, this four song EP is sure to resonate until the release of their next full-length record is released. Mixed by Bill Stevenson and Andrew Belin at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, Bill has also mixed records by Less Then Jake, The Suicide Machines, and Good Riddance as well as playing drums, producing, and recording for his own bands, All and The Descendents. King Django (Stubborn All-Stars, King Django Band) also contributed to mixing the dub version of 'The Pace' at Version City Studios. Lastly the man to master just about every punk record that has mattered over the past ten years, Alan Douches at West West Side Music made his contribution to these tracks as well.
