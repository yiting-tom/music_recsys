fugitive on the run<br>Christopher made a quick escape<br><br>While being transported in a van<br>That was picking up convicts state to state<br>He did it during a bathroom break<br>He hot-wired somebody's pickup<br><br>In fact Christopher had a long history of theft<br>Involving trucks<br>He was on route to Alabama<br>For stealing someone's travel trailer<br><br>Grand Theft Auto<br>He was a career criminal, jailbird<br>Who also had a three outstanding warrants<br>In his home state of Tennessee<br><br>It was an outstanding performance that set him free<br> Little Houdini<br><br>Stole a big rig, then a tour bus<br>That belonged to Crystal Gayle<br>To evade a five state manhunt<br>That wanted to put that birdy back in jail<br>But they failed<br><br>'Cause Christopher wasn't just running from cops<br>Christopher Gay was now racing a clock<br>His mother was dying<br>And there was no time to be held<br>Inside of a cage with locks<br><br>So you all can  turn up your nose<br>And suck on your teeth<br>And wag your finger like, tsk-tsk<br>But he had to take the risk<br>Little Houdini<br><br>It wasn't a single thing sinister in his decision<br>To break from the prison<br>His only motive was to go back to his childhood home<br>While his mom was still living<br><br>It wasn't a house<br>More like an old mobile camper<br>Where she was bedridden<br>Diagnosed with colon cancer<br><br>Sometimes the only answer we're left with<br>When the loved one's name is on the death list<br>Is to head for the exits and go home<br><br>Christopher got the hell out of Texas<br>His abandonment was reckless<br>It prolonged his sentence<br>Y'all can forget it<br><br>He had numerous convictions<br>And none were as strong as this<br>Unless you consider the other instance<br>He went the distance<br><br>Similar situation, it was a bizarre coincidence<br>When he escaped from the prison the first time<br>Not this time but the one before<br>He visited his dad<br><br>'Cause he was dying inside of a mental ward<br>Suffering from Alzheimer's<br>He paid respects, made his peace<br>When he was done, he didn't run<br>He returned himself back to the police<br><br>That's when his mom made her plea<br>She said, 'He knows what he's done was wrong<br>But he knows his father don't got long<br>He's not a fugitive on the run<br>He's not dangerous, he's our son<br>He ain't never hurt no one'<br><br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>He knows what he's done was wrong<br>But he knows his father don't got long<br>He's not a fugitive on the run<br>He's our

wheeler, he's peeling rubber<br>The bird takes flight down turnpikes<br><br>Three hundred thousand dollars of merchandise<br>But it ain't worth her life<br>Ran it off the road and abandoned it<br>50 yards from his mom to avoid the cops<br>That's half a football field from her feeble arms<br><br>After all this stuff, the tour bus, the pickup trucks<br>The tractor trailer, interstate chases<br>He put on the brakes and couldn't get close enough<br>The news reporter told people to lock their doors<br>Like there was a monster on the loose<br>But there was no truth to those reports<br><br>His mom had weeks to live<br>And Chris had years to serve<br>They were within shouting distance<br>But I don't think he heard her final words<br>I don't think he heard her final words<br><br>She made her plea to the TV<br><br>He knows what he's done was wrong<br>But he knows his mama don't got long<br>He's not a fugitive on the run<br>He's not dangerous, he's my son<br>He ain't never hurt no one<br><br>He knows what he's done was wrong<br>But he knows his mama don't got long<br>He's not a fugitive on the run<br>He's my son<br><br>This ain't no country western song.<br><br>The third time he escaped<br>From a state cop at the Georgia pit-stop<br>He just slipped out of the handcuffs<br>He jumped ship then he took off<br><br>With no father to visit, no mom to go home to<br>Just an open road where he could be free<br>Little Houdini<br><br>With no father to visit, no mom to go home to<br>Just a wide open sky where he could fly<br>With no father to visit, no mom to go home to<br>Just an
