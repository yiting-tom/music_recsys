<br>
<br>
   My Best Friend Is You is the second album by English singer-songwriter Kate Nash, to be released in the United Kingdom on 19 April 2010.<br><br>The first single from the album is to be 'Do-Wah-Doo'. Nash confirmed on her blog that she filmed the music video for the single on the Thursday 18th February 2010,'I shot the video for Do Wah Doo last week on thursday and it was so so much fun! The best fun I ever had on a video shoot. It stars a lot of my wonderful friends who are pretty much amazing. I wrote the treatment almost a year ago, it』s a love story set on a plane in the late 50』s, for some reason the idea has always been in my head.' Nash also posted some pictures of the video shoot, showing her and her friends (including photographer and close friend Wesley Goode, who starred in Nash's video for 'Pumpkin Soup') on a plane. The music video was available from March 4th 2010. <br><br>The official artwork for the sleeve leaked on March 17, 2010 appearing first on Kuwaiti music blog Loft965.com. <br><br>On April 9 2010 Nash took part in a timesonline.co.uk web chat. When asked a question about the albums artwork this was her response... 'hey dave it's been pretty stressful getting all the artwork together on this album because i've cared so much about it and had so many ideas and wanted it to be perfect for my second record. i worked with a lady called kate gibb who does screen printing, we screen printed a bunch of photos and some of my own objects to create collages inspired by images that i collected and loved, they varied from the bauhaus art movement to punk and lo fi record covers because i love the simplicity in those. i've just got through all the final artwork and it was worth the hardwork because i love how it looks. I try to be as involved as possible in every single aspect of what i do so that it represents me properly and because it's fun and i care and i'm a control freeeeak.'<br><br>'I Just Love You More' was made available on Nash's official website for free digital download, while 'Don't You Want to Share the Guilt' appeared on the single 'Merry Happy' from the previous album Made of Bricks.<br><br> <br>
