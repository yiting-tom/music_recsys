<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> The Fullness Of Time</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>[I. Rage：]<br><br>Struck down by the persons that I trusted<br>Robbed of dignity and left for dead<br>I can feel unmeasurable anger building in me<br>Emptiness and rage begin to burn inside my head<br>Once I was a person without malice<br>Once my heart bled red instead of black<br>Friends with one hand held behind their backs carried knives<br>Didn't see the blades 'till they were buried in my back<br>Sleep with one eye open<br>Knowing that I'm watching you<br>Listen for my footsteps on every darkened street<br>Like a call for help unanswered<br>You can scream but no one hears your voice<br>No one there to save you<br>As I take my just revenge<br>I can hear your laughter<br>I can see you think you've won<br>But I don't know how you live<br>With no remorse for what you have done<br>You claimed you were my friend<br>All the while you planned to murder me<br>You claimed that I imagined all the things you'd done to me<br>You'll pay for being so destructive<br>You'll beg for compassion<br>But I've nothing left to give<br><br>[II. Despair:]<br><br>Left now<br>Alone with your betrayal<br>There's no way to feel secure<br>Anymore<br>Broken<br>Crushed in soul and spirit<br>With no way to set things right again<br>Gone<br>You have stolen everything I ever had<br>And I'm left with nothing more than pain<br>And I know I'll never trust the way that I once did<br>You have taken all my dreams<br>And turned them to ashes in my mouth<br>Starving<br>Searching for some comfort<br>Left to choke on my despair<br>Blinded<br>My faith and friendship shattered<br>And my life beyond repair<br><br>[III. Release:]<br><br>Lying here surrounded<br>By the pieces of my life<br>Would it all be easier<br>If I lay be down to die<br>Dreams piled high<br>On the back of this broken man<br>Is this all? Born to fall?<br>Or to rise again?<br>So much pain and disillusionment<br>Everything I once felt sure about<br>We're all lost if we don't know<br>It's all a game that we are playing<br>The motions of all our counterparts<br>A piece of sinister scheme<br>The puppet that's broken has reason to smile<br>They can no longer force him to dance on their strings<br>Why shrug off the chains? If you wrap them about<br>You'll be sunk to the bottom and drowning<br>The clockwork behind their smiles<br>Wound by hands that were made to harm<br>Just release yourself<br>Cause they can't rape the willing<br>Or take what you have if there's nothing else<br>Tired of life and filled with despair<br>And covered with blood from the crosses I bear<br>But I'm still standing<br>Should I make myself crawl?<br>Seems so counter to our nature<br>Accepting with grace the things we can't change<br>But when all's said and done and you're wronged and deceived<br>Then it matters than most what you choose to believe<br>Should I fight against fate<br>Or should I just lay down and die?<br>The puppet that's broken has reason to smile<br>But the strings can't control you if you walk away<br>No more tears of disillusionment<br>I'll be a puppet no longer<br>The hands that I thought had held me<br>The clockwork behind their smiles<br>They'll not have control over me<br>I'll stand up and leave them behind<br>Just release yourself<br>Cause they can't rape the willing<br>Or take what you have if there's nothing else<br>Tired of life and filled with despair<br>And covered with blood from the crosses I bear<br>But I'm still standing<br>Should I make myself crawl?<br>Just release yourself<br>When you're wounded by no one else<br>Rise above pain, most past my despair<br>And put down the cross that I've made myself bear<br>Now I'm still standing<br>And I'm not gonna crawl<br><br>[IV. Transcendence:]<br><br>Now<br>The smoke finally cleared<br>And I can see the wreckage of my past that lies about me<br>Now<br>It's all become so clear<br>And I have learned the<br>Truth behind the lies and seen the lies within the truth<br>Everything in context finally makes sense<br>I see the paths I walked<br>Some I paved myself<br>Some where I went gladly<br>Some against my will<br>I<br>Can leave behind the fear and doubt<br>And cast aside the shackles and the chains<br>Of flawed assumptions I learned as a child<br>I can't let them distract me<br>So I'm Putting aside the memories<br>Of the things I never had but thought I wanted<br>Now<br>My notions of what makes relationships have a new light<br>I have gained an understanding<br>No more false facades<br>Covering my feelings<br>Preventing a connection<br>I've been spending my whole life pursuing those who built this cell<br>Lamenting all the hateful things that happened to me<br>Never thought to look at how I might have played a part in who I am<br>Or what it means to lose the game before it starts<br>Now I know that I cannot turn back and change the past<br>And that the only choice to save myself<br>Is changing what I carry from it<br>Everything I did to myself<br>Everything that's been done to me<br>I'll turn my back on that and walk away<br>And left with only me<br>At last I see the answer and what I need to be<br>Letting go<br>I destroy my shell<br>Embrace my heart<br>And free myself<br>The point of the search, may not be the answer<br>The value of a want, is not always a need<br>Still I stand, I'm not going to crawl<br>Now I know, I've got to believe<br>Once I was a person without malice<br>Once my heart bled red instead of black<br>Openness and introspection now show me the way<br>To reclaim all I've lost and take it back<br>You may have taken everything I ever had<br>But you cannot take my future<br>Just release yourself<br>All I was and<br>All that I'll ever be<br>Finally are integrated<br>And I am whole again<br>Now I know the reason for the suffering<br>I'm a better person for having known the pain<br>A better person having overcome the pain<br><br>
