<dd class="hb0">Like Moths to Flames is an American metalcore band from Columbus, Ohio. The band has released four full-length albums, a 7', and one extended play through Rise Records.<br><br>History<br>Inception<br><br>The band was formed in early 2010. Vocalist Chris Roetter, having sung for the bands Agraceful and Emarosa beforehand, formed Like Moths to Flames with four of the six members of Ohio metalcore band TerraFirma: Aaron Evans (who joined playing rhythm guitar before later moving to bass); Zach Huston (lead guitar); Aaron Douglas (bass); and Jordan Matz (drums). The band released their debut single titled 'Dead Routine' on February 7, 2010. Prior to the release of debut EP Sweet Talker, they would release two more demos, 'Avada Kedavra' and 'Death Eaters.'<br>Sweet Talker and Rise Records (2010)<br><br>On October 17, 2010 it was announced that Like Moths to Flames had been signed to Rise Records and were already working on their first EP. Two months later, the band released their EP titled Sweet Talker on December 14, 2010. To help support their new music, the band set out with fellow acts Texas in July and A Hero a Fake on the 'A Metal Christmas' tour through late 2010. Sometime before their EP was released, drummer Jordan Matz left Like Moths to Flames, and was replaced by Lance Greenfield.<br>When We Don't Exist and Line-up Changes (2011–2012)<br><br>With continuous touring through 2011, the band decided to settle back down and head into the studio to record their first full-length studio album. Right before the band headed to the studio, bassist Aaron Douglas parted ways with the band. The band had Eli Ford (formerly of My Ticket Home) join on guitar and Aaron Evans moved to bass. When We Don't Exist was released on November 8 through Rise Records. In January 2012, the band headed out on the S.I.N. Tour with acts D.R.U.G.S., Hit the Lights and Sparks the Rescue to support the album. Soon after, they toured with bands Texas in July and Hundredth.<br>An Eye For An Eye (2013–2014)<br><br>The band then spent the first half of 2013 headlining the Rise Records tour around the US with supporting acts Crown the Empire, The Color Morale, Palisades and My Ticket Home. The band recorded their second full-length album with Will Putney at (The Machine Shop) in Hoboken, New Jersey and was released July 9, 2013. On May 29, 2013, the band confirmed the new album was called An Eye for an Eye. The album debuted at number 63 on the Billboard 200 top sales. They toured with the Vans Warped Tour over the summer of 2013 on the Monster Energy Stage. Shortly after the All Stars Tour 2014, guitarist Zach Huston decided to part ways with the band citing that he wants to pursue other interests. It wasn't until late in 2015 that he was replaced by guitarist Jeremy Smith, formerly of City Lights.<br>The Dream Is Dead and The Dying Things We Live For (2015–2016)<br><br>In a Q&amp;A interview with Stheart, Chris Roetter announced the band has been writing new music and intends to release it 'soon.' On Monday, April 6, the band released a standalone release on 7' Vinyl called 'The Dream is Dead', featuring two tracks - the A-side being 'Bury Your Pain' and the B-side being 'What's Done is Done'.<br><br>The band's third full-length album, The Dying Things We Live For, was announced on 3 September 2015, confirming its release date to be October 23, 2015. Upon release, the album debuted at number 150 on the Billboard 200. Three singles from the album have been released thus far, with music videos accompanying two of the songs - 'Fighting Fire with Fire', and 'Wither'.<br>Dark Divine (2017–present)<br><br>On September 8th, 2017, the band released the lead single from the forthcoming album, 'Nowhere Left to Sink.' They announced that the album would be released on November 3rd, 2017. The music video for 'Nowhere Left to Sink' was released exclusively to AltPress on September 26th. They released a promotional single and title track, 'Dark Divine' through Loudwire on October 6th. A second promotional single, 'Empty the Same' was released on October 13th. A third promotional single, 'Shallow Truths for Shallow Minds' was released on October 19th via Tattoo.com.
