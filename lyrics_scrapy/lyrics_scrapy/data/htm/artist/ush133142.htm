<dd class="hb0">Ernest Loring 'Red' Nichols (May 8, 1905 – June 28, 1965) was an American jazz cornettist, composer, and jazz bandleader.<br><br>Over his long career, Nichols recorded in a wide variety of musical styles, and critic Steve Leggett describes him as 'an expert cornet player, a solid improviser, and apparently a workaholic, since he is rumored to have appeared on over 4,000 recordings during the 1920s alone.'</dd>
