Guess you got a lotta girls that tell you the same thing. And if you don't wanna read this, well, you don't have to. But I just had to tell you about the time I saw you in 'It Happened One Night'. That was the first time I ever saw you, and I knew right then you were the nicest fella in the movies! I guess it was 'cause you acted so, well so natural like - not like a real actor at all, but just like any fella you'd meet at shool or at a party. Then one time I saw you in a picture with Joan Crawford, and I had to cry a little 'cause you loved her so much and you couldn't have her - not 'till the end of the picture, anyway. And then one time I saw you in person. You were making a personal appearance at the theatre, and I was standing there when you got out of your car, and you almost knocked me down! Oh - but it wasn't your fault! Naw, I was in the way. But you looked at me, and you smiled. Yeah! You smiled right at me as if you meant it, and I cried all the way home just 'cause you smiled at me for being in your way! Aw, I'll never forget it, Mr. Gable. Honest injun. You're my favorite actor!<br><br>(singing)<br><br>I don't care what happens, let the whole world stop.<br>As far as I'm concerned, you'll always be the top,<br>'cause you know you made me love you.<br><br>b.For Me And My Gal<br>Lyrics:Edgar Leslie/Ray Goetz Music:George W.Meyer<br><br>What a beautiful day<br>For a wedding in May!<br>See the people all stare<br>At the loveable pair.<br><br>She's a vision of joy,<br>He's the luckiest boy.<br>In his wedding array<br>Hear him smilingly say:<br><br>The bells are ringing for me and my gal,<br>The birds are singing for me and my gal.<br>Everybody's been knowing<br>To a wedding they're going<br>And for weeks they've been sewing,<br>Every Susie and Sal.<br>They're congregating for me and my gal,<br>The Parson's waiting for me and my gal.<br>And sometime<br>I'm goin' to build a little home for two,<br>For three or four or more,<br>In Love-land for me and my gal.<br><br>See the relatives there<br>Looking over the pair!<br>They can tell at a glance<br>It's a loving romance.<br><br>It's a wonderful sight<br>As the families unite.<br>Gee! It makes the boy proud<br>As he says to the crowd:<br><br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>The bells are ringing for me and my gal,<br>The birds are singing for me and my gal.<br>Everybody's been knowing<br>To a wedding they're going<br>And for weeks they've been sewing,<br>Every Susie and Sal.<br>They're congregating for me and my gal,<br>The Parson's waiting for me and my gal.<br>And sometime<br>I'm goin' to build a little home for two,<br>For three or four or more,<br>In Love-land for me and my gal.<br><br>(repeat chorus)<br><br>c.The Boy Next Door<br>Lyrics:Hugh Martin/Ralph Blane Music:Hugh Martin/Ralph Blane<br><br>The moment I saw him smile,<br>I knew he was just my style,<br>My only regret is we've never met,<br>Though I dream of him all the while.<br><br>But he doesn't know I exist,<br>No matter how I may persist,<br>So it's clear to see there's no hope for me,<br>Though I live at 5135 Kensington Avenue<br>And he lives at 5133.<br><br>How can I ignore<br>The boy next door?<br>I love him more than I can say.<br>Doesn't try to please me, doesn't even tease me,<br>And he never sees me glance his way.<br><br>And though I'm heart-sore<br>The boy next door affection for me won't display,<br>I just adore him, so I can't ignore him,<br>The boy next door.<br><br>I just adore him, so I can't ignore him,<br>The boy next door.<br><br>d.The Trolley Song<br>Lyrics:Ralph Blane/Hugh Martin Music:Ralph Blane/Hugh Martin<br><br>With my high starched-collar and my high-topped shoes<br>And my hair piled high upon my head,<br>I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley, and lost my heart instead.<br>With his light brown derby and his bright green tie,<br>He was quite the handsomest of men.<br>I started to yen so I counted to ten, then I counted to ten again.<br><br>Clang, clang, clang went the trolley, ding, ding, ding went the bell,<br>Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings, from the moment I saw him I fell.<br>Chug, chug, chug went the motor, bump, bump, bump went the brake,<br>Thump, thump, thump went my heart strings, when he smiled I could feel the car shake.<br>He tipped his hat, and took a seat, he said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet.<br>He asked my name, I held my breath.<br>I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death.<br>Chug, chug, chug went the motor, pop, pop, pop went the wheels,<br>Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings,<br>As he started to go then I started to know how it feels, when the universe reels.<br>The day was bright, the air was sweet,<br>The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet.<br>You tried to sing, but couldn't squeak, in fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak.<br>Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer, plop, plop, plop went the wheels,<br>Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings,<br>As he started to leave, I took hold of his sleeve with my hand,<br>And as if it were planned, he stayed on with me and it was grand just to stand<br>With his hand holding mine to the end of the line.<br><br>
