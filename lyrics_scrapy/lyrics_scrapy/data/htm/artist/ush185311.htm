<dd class="hb0">X Ambassadors (also stylized XA) is an American rock band from Ithaca, New York. It currently consists of lead vocalist Sam Harris, keyboardist Casey Harris, lead guitarist Noah Feldshuh, and drummer Adam Levin. Their most notable songs include 'Jungle', 'Renegades', and 'Unsteady'. The band's debut full-length album, VHS, was released on June 30, 2015.<br><br>History<br>2009–12: Ambassadors EP and Litost<br><br>X Ambassadors began as a band titled simply Ambassadors, touring with artists such as LIGHTS. During this time, they self-released their debut EP, Ambassadors EP, creating a music video for its lead single, 'Tropisms'. Shortly after, the band self-released its debut LP, Litost, which included the song 'Litost', which would later be used on the soundtrack for The Host. The band signed a music publishing deal in 2012 with SONGS Music Publishing. The band started a Kickstarter account to shoot a video for the lead single, 'Unconsolable,' which would be re-recorded later. The group was noticed by Imagine Dragons while frontman Dan Reynolds was sick in the hospital in Norfolk, Virginia. Reynolds heard an acoustic version of 'Unconsolable' on 96X WROX-FM and asked Interscope to sign the band as soon as possible.<br>2013–14: Love Songs Drug Songs EP and The Reason EP<br><br>X Ambassadors released their debut major label EP, Love Songs Drug Songs in 2013. The EP included the track 'Stranger' co-written by Dan Reynolds. In promotion of the EP they toured supporting Imagine Dragons, Jimmy Eat World and The Mowglis. In 2014, the band released a second major label EP, The Reason. In promotion of the new EP, X Ambassadors supported Panic! at the Disco and Imagine Dragons on their respective tours. They also featured in The Knocks' single 'Comfortable' from their second EP with the same name.<br>2015–16: VHS and The Knocks collaboration<br><br>VHS is X Ambassadors' debut LP. The album was released June 30 via digital download, vinyl record and CD. The album features 20 tracks, including 7 interludes and 3 previously released songs for a total of 10 new songs. The album features collaborations with Jamie N Commons and Imagine Dragons.<br><br>X Ambassadors appeared as a collaboration on their earlier title 'Comfortable' with The Knocks', which was originally released back in 2013, as part of the duo's debut album, entitled 55, which was released in March 2016. However, later on in the year, X Ambassadors lead singer Sam Harris was reunited with the duo in their new collaboration, entitled 'Heat', which was released in October 2016.<br><br>On June 20, 2016, the band announced that Feldshuh would be taking an indefinite hiatus from the band to deal with personal issues.<br>2017–present: Upcoming second studio album<br><br>In 2017, X Ambassadors released four singles in 2017: 'Hoping' in March, 'Torches' in April, 'The Devil You Know' in June, and 'Ahead of Myself' in July, from their second studio album.  In addition, they also performed at the 2017 National Scout Jamboree.<br>Musical style and influences<br><br>In an interview with Caitlin White, X Ambassadors declared themselves distinctly rock with few characteristics commonly associated with indie bands. They referenced Incubus, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Michael Bolton as heroes. These bands can be heard as influences on X Ambassadors' sound.<br>Philanthropy<br><br>In January 2017, Sam Harris participated in the official Women’s March on Washington after-party. Harris was joined by The National, Ani DiFranco, Samantha Ronson and Sleater-Kinney and many others.<br><br>In March 2017, X Ambassadors performed a special show to benefit Planned Parenthood on International Women’s Day.<br><br>Following the benefit show, X Ambassadors released the song “Hoping” on March 10. All proceeds from the song for the six month following its release were donated to the ACLU.<br><br>In June 2017, X Ambassadors announced that they would donate all their proceeds from their Mississippi Coast Coliseum Show show to Unity Mississippi - a GLBT charitable organization following the announcement that the State of Mississippi signed HB 1523 - the “Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act” into law.<br>Band members<br><br>Current members<br><br>    Sam Harris – lead vocals, guitar, saxophone, bass, drums, percussion (2009–present)<br>    Casey Harris – piano, keyboards, backing vocals (2009–present)<br>    Adam Levin – drums, percussion (2009-present)<br>    Noah Feldshuh – lead guitar, bass, backing vocals (2009–present)<br><br>Sam Harris and Casey Harris are brothers, and have been friends with Feldshuh since kindergarten in Ithaca.
