<br>
Spitvalves are from and will always be from Orlando Florida. In stark contrast to the polished, produced and pre-packaged pop music that has currently become the flavor of the region, Spitvalves have defined themselves by NOT putting their fans and music in front of any image conscience sensibilities.<br><br>Formed seven years ago by a dynamic mix of cultures and influences, Spitvalves are held together by their love of music and performing it live. With influences ranging from the Mighty Mighty Bosstones to Fugazi and the Beastie Boys, Spitvalves continue to defy the boundaries of the Ska-Core category from which they dominate.<br><br>Since the initial release of “Fine Print at the Bottom,” (which was co produced by Roman Flysher of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones) the Spitvalves have played over 100 shows, 4 of which were at last summers Vans Warped Tour. Thanx to the many live performances under their belt, the Spitvalves are now capable of reproducing the same tight knit sound that is found on “Fine Print at the Bottom.”<br><br>While many bands adhere to the D.I.Y. ethic, the Spitvalves truly live it. In the past three years, the Spitvalves have enjoyed three self produced releases on their own label. They have crisscrossed across the country on several self booked tours and continue to churn out an unbelievable amount of merchandise on their very own silkscreen press.<br><br>Just recently the Spitvalves won the category of “Best Ska/Punk” band by the readers of the Orlando Weekly and are currently touring local clubs throughout the Southeast and the US.<br><br>The Spitvalves are: Charlie Bender (Vocals), Mikey Cortes (Guitar), Tito Esquiaqui (Drums), Bill Lance (Trombone), Ricky San Jose (Trumpet), and Chris Young (Saxaphone.) <br><br>1.
