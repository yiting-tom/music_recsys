<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
After bursting onto the bluegrass scene in 2011 with their Top 10 debut album Lonesome Whistle, The Roy's followed with their sophomore project New Day Dawning in 2012. This landmark album debuted at Number 2 on the Billboard Bluegrass Albums Chart, dominated the Hot Disc Top 40, and reached Number 1 on Amazon's Bluegrass Best Sellers list. Additionally, on the week of September 21, all of the songs from this E P owned positions on the Bluegrass Today Chart, making The Roy's the first ever act to hold that honor.<br>Now, after much anticipation, The Roy's release their third CD for Rural Rhythm, Gypsy Runaway Train. This project celebrates the roots of the genre (with a collection of seven standards included on the album), yet introduces six new songs written by the award winning duo.<br>The new songs include up tempo tracks You Can Count on My Love (which celebrates new love) and Gypsy Runaway Train, (which pays homage to all the fans), as well as the deeply personal, poignant song Half of Me, written by Elaine Roy while experiencing the heartbreak of a divorce the album strips away all pretenses and gives the listener a glimpse at both the highs and lows of life. Once again, Lee and Elaine have collaborated on some of these tracks with today s best songwriters, including Steve Dean, Morry Trent, Arlis Albritton and country star Josh Thompson.<br>The cover tracks include The Roy's favorites, such as Blue Moon of Kentucky, and I Wonder Where You Are Tonight. The Roy's also wanted to include a gospel song on the album, one that Lee sang throughout his life, He Took Your Place.<br>Elaine s personal influences are also heard on the album. As a big fan of Dolly Parton, she fell in love with the song Those Memories (which also featured Emmylou Harris and Linda Rondstadt). As a result, Elaine had been singing it on stage for a long time and the fans would always ask if they had this song on an album.and now they do!<br>Lee s favorites can also heard on the album. He fell in love with the song Born with a Hammer in My Hand since he first heard Blue Highway do it and it is one of his favorite bluegrass songs, as is the Adam Steffey song What Gives You the Right. The Roy's also pay tribute to Merle Haggard, one of Lee s favorite singers with their rendition of Ramblin Fever.<br>With the success of both of our past album, we always hope to expand our listeners. This album is different because we have written some of the songs and chosen some of our favorite cover songs that we have been doing throughout our career. We have also used our own band in the studio.<br><br>Being creative is very exciting and to hear our music come to life is the icing on the cake. We hope it brings the listeners on a musical journey and maybe takes them back in time also. - Elaine Roy
