He scored seven Top 20 chart hits in the UK over an almost six-year period, starting in December 1952.<br><br>Biography<br><br>He was born Reginald Hogan Bretagne, and lived at Ebrahim Terrace, Spence Road, Byculla, Bombay, India of Anglo-Indian descent. During the 1950s Brent became a popular UK based vocalist, having relocated there in 1947. Two years after his move, Brent entered and was successful in a talent show held at the Regal Theatre in Kingston. He had sung a version of 'Some Enchanted Evening', and this led him on to work with Ambrose and Cyril Stapleton's BBC Showband. His subsequent chart hits included 'Walkin' to Missouri', 'Cindy, Oh Cindy' and 'Dark Moon'. Brent's hits were all released on the Columbia label. He enjoyed iconic status in South Asia where his hits topped the music charts on Radio Ceylon.<br><br>He resumed his travels in 1961, and left the UK to live in Australia. He owned a succession of Indian food restaurants, whilst maintaining his singing career. Brent died in Sydney, at the age of 65, of a heart attack in June 1993.
