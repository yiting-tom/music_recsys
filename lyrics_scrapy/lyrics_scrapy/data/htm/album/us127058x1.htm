<br>
<br>
Tony Pastor - tenor saxophonist, singer and bandleader - had a successful career in music for around forty years and in particular from the late 1930s through to the mid 1960s. He was a well-known and popular figure on the American entertainment scene, and although his big band was never among the country's most famous orchestras, it consistently played excellent dance music. Tony's ebullient style of singing and playing proved an attraction on records, radio and in personal appearances. Tunes in this collection like 'Maria, Mari' and 'One Meat Ball' were common offerings both Louis Prima or Tony Pastor style. The Tony Pastor brand of lively, happy sounding music is well represented on this compact disc. The majority of the tracks are vocal numbers but on the instrumental side the band shows its ability as a fine swinging unit on 'Ready, Get Set, Jump' and 'Flag Waver', while 'Blossoms', Tony s theme song, is a slow, melodic ballad. In the 1950s, Tony made fewer appearances as leader of a big band, concentrating instead on a stage act that also featured his two singing sons, Tony Jnr., and Guy. <br><br>1.
