<dd class="hb0">Kim Hyun-ah (born June 6, 1992), better known by the mononym Hyuna, stylized as HyunA, is a South Korean singer, dancer, songwriter and model. She rose to fame in the late 2000s as a member of the girl group Wonder Girls, leaving the ensemble shortly after their debut in 2007 and subsequently joining the girl group 4Minute in 2009. Hyuna began a solo career in 2010, which she describes as 'performance-oriented music'. Her debut single 'Change' peaked at #2 on the Gaon Digital Chart.<br><br>She released her first extended play Bubble Pop! in 2011. Though the EP was a moderate seller, its title track sold more than 2.5 million copies, and Hyuna became the first female K-pop solo artist to reach 100 million views on a single YouTube video. In 2012, she appeared in Psy's worldwide hit 'Gangnam Style', which also led to a successful duet rendition of the song. Hyuna's second EP Melting (2012) saw her first number one entry on the Gaon chart with the single 'Ice Cream'.<br><br>Following 4Minute's disbandment in 2016, she released her fifth EP A'wesome which was supported by her first concert tour of the United States. Hyuna has collaborated with several of her label mates under Cube Entertainment, first forming the duo Trouble Maker with Jang Hyun-seung in 2011; which spawned two number-one singles. In 2017, she was involved in the trio Triple H, releasing the EP 199X.</dd>
