They achieved moderate success during their career. Their lineup included Steve Rawlings (vocals), Paul Nash (guitar), Lyndon Scarfe (keyboards), Tim Wright (bass guitar) and Paul Gilmartin (drums). Scarfe was replaced by David Whitaker (formerly of Music for Pleasure) after the Heaven Is Waiting album.<br><br>Background<br>First incarnation<br><br>Originally called Y? and then Danse Crazy (changed due to the emerging Two Tone scene), Danse Society recorded and released their first single, 'Clock', on their own newly formed record label Society in 1980. They released their debut studio album, Seduction, in 1982. It reached No. 3 in the UK Indie Chart.<br><br>Their second studio album, Heaven Is Waiting, was released in December 1983 on record label Arista. It reached No. 39 in the UK albums chart. The album contained a cover of The Rolling Stones' song '2000 Light Years from Home', also edited in 1984 as a 12' single and as a limited-edition double single. In 1986, after releasing their final album, Looking Through, as The Danse Society International, all of the band members except lead singer Rawlings left to form Johnny in the Clouds.<br><br>Rawlings continued as Society, and in 1987, released a single, 'Saturn Girl'. After 1987, Rawlings continued to pursue music with the electronic dance music act Meridian Dream.<br>Reformation<br><br>A campaign titled The Danse Society Reformation Plot was started on Facebook at the end of 2009 and succeeded in bringing most of the band back together.[citation needed] The reformed Danse Society, featuring new vocalist Maethelyiah from the group Blooding Mask, released their fourth studio album, Change of Skin, in July 2011. This was followed in November 2011 with the first single to be taken from the album, 'God Cry'. In April 2012 they released the second single from Change of Skin, 'Vatican', backed with a reworking of their classic early song 'Seduction'. Their first live gig in 25 years was performed at Germany's Wave-Gotik-Treffen festival in May 2012, followed by selected festival dates and the addition of bassist Martin Roberts.[citation needed]<br><br>Their fifth studio album, Scarey Tales, was released in February 2013.<br><br>On 1 February 2014, Danse Society issued an official announcement that Gilmartin and Roberts had unexpectedly resigned from the band, resulting in the cancellation of a series of tour dates. Nash, Whitaker and Maethelyiah continued with Danse Society, joined by new bassist Lee Jones and drummer Iain Hunter. David Whitaker was replaced by Sam Bollands in late 2014, with Jack Cooper replacing Lee Jones.
