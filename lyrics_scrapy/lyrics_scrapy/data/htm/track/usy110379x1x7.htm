<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> Strange And Unproductive Thinking</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>Lyricist：David Lynch、Dean Hurley<br>Composer：David Lynch、Dean Hurley<br><br>Bearing all the aforementioned dialogues we discover the possibilities of<br>the curve towards progressive behavior and the ultimate realization of the<br>goal of evolution, which grants the benefits of added awareness with<br>unlimited boundness of happiness, also known as bliss, which is a result of<br>the laws which govern physical behavior merging with the highest levels of<br>spirit, and together manifesting the magical and mystical level of cosmic<br>awareness, becoming one with the longing for complete surrender to the<br>higher self, which has potentially been waiting these long eons of time,<br>and in fact sometimes has been dipping into a state of semi-sleep or<br>unconsciousness, bordering on complete absence of thought.<br><br>Specifically, the areas concerning the new futuristic thinking have to do<br>with several abstract, somewhat hidden, emotional tendencies which lead one<br>to believe that the consequences of interaction between the positive and<br>negative forces are producing a vital link between the subconscious and<br>superconscious minds, which therefore can only be considered as actual<br>structures with two separate and distinctly different qualities.<br><br>As we have seen, when one or more intensely feeling energies become<br>associated with the higher levels of perceptible phenomenon, and these new<br>forms are then instantly acted upon by the two minds previously discussed,<br>and brand new associations are given over with resulting problems sorting<br>out the new strains of emotional and physical qualities we see cropping up<br>in schools and places of business across the country, and in the cities<br>which of course have the added complications of the much-argued-over<br>proposition that one cannot tolerate the existence of two or more intensely<br>opposing ideas at one point in time.<br><br>Others may find it easier to say 'however,' and that thought alone is one<br>which troubles many of us here who have for so long held the light up on<br>the words which brought meaning to us concerning the amount of effort it<br>takes to ignite a certain process leading one to the knowledge of the truce<br>behind the alternating essence which is unending without actually<br>beginning, and in those words of course is the key to beginning a long<br>journey toward understanding which, as we have learned, is something for<br>which each human being cries out, cupping his hands over the mouth.<br><br>Sometimes in the evenings a feeling of the type which haunts young children<br>in the forest will come in on a dark wind, and all the light will fade<br>leaving a low sound penetrating the eyes, which follow the dark shapes<br>running for safe nests just out of reach of small white teeth and noses<br>filled with dirt going up over the mountains covered with tall trees and<br>green needles and red bark with pitch oozing out into the air, which dries<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>it on the surface causing it to become crusty which allows for the<br>protection of all that lies within the crust, for it will now remain liquid<br>and hold itself remaining in a state close to that of the pure essence<br>which will remind us of home, which will remind us of the red cookie-jar,<br>and the smiles dancing around in the golden afternoons, while the pipe<br>puffs out small clouds of smoke from the mouth of the father with an axe to<br>cut wood growing on the tall mountains.<br><br>In order to assure that the fundamental qualities inherent in the solutions<br>to modern philosophical questions are accurate, the first and foremost<br>consideration lies in the field of abstractions associated with the loss of<br>nature, and with them the interaction of the primary forces of life itself<br>which have now been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt to have their basis<br>in the field of the absolute in the vacuum state bringing to mind that<br>there has been a reversal of sorts of the age-old phrase, 'You can't get<br>something from nothing.' As we have seen this kind of thinking which has<br>been going on since the beginning of time is just a smoke-screen necessary<br>to block almost all truthful inquiries for centuries following, and it is<br>with this also on our minds that we see that the initial thinking on a<br>subject is critical to all that follows, and can be an excellent partner to<br>the dark and evil forces which would have us living forever in darkness and<br>confusion, refusing even to acknowledge that we even existed, or that there<br>was such a thing as a bad tooth, or a tooth-ache.<br><br>Bringing our discussion to the realm of practical considerations, it is<br>interesting to note the possibilities of dental hygiene and the remarkable<br>idea of a world free of tooth-decay and all other problems associated with<br>the teeth, tongue, or oral cavity, which would, in fact, become a prime<br>motivator for a certain disappearance of fears associated with pain<br>connected with dental applications, and even the idea that plaque could<br>appear upon the surface of the teeth, and the negative occurrences which<br>follow such as the hideous odors emitted from the oral cavity and the<br>discolorations and the resulted perforation of the once beautiful mental<br>images, and the possibility of the breaking of relationships based upon the<br>idea of negative distortion of the mouth, for teeth, while not necessarily<br>considered one of the primary building blocks of happiness, can in fact<br>become a small sore, festering and transferring negative energies to the<br>once quiet and peaceful mind, giving it over to strange and unproductive<br>thinking.<br><br>(x4) Strange and unproductive thinking.<br><br>(x3) Unproductive thinking.<br><br>
