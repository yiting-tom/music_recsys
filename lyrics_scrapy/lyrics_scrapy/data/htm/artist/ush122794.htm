<dd class="hb0">The Boys Town Gang were a disco and Hi-NRG band from San Francisco, California. Their popularity peaked in the 1980s when the group reached No. 5 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart with the single 'Cruisin' the Streets' (No. 4 on the UK Singles chart) and No. 1 in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain with their cover version of 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You'.<br><br><br>History<br><br>In 1980, DJ Bill Motley saw an opportunity to form a group that catered to San Francisco's large gay clientele. In his search to form a group, he auditioned hundreds of vocalists, both male and female. Local cabaret singer Cynthia Manley captured the lead spot.<br><br>The idea was originally for one 12' single with two tracks of high energy music. Motley, a Diana Ross fan, picked two Ashford &amp; Simpson songs to form a medley for the A-side track. For the B-side track, he wrote a disco drama in four acts. A private record label was founded to release the two songs.<br><br>When 'Remember Me'/'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' was released, the song took off with Manley's vocals propelling the song to the top of the club charts. The four-act explicit 'Cruisin' The Streets' was a snapshot of San Francisco's South of Market District - Ringold Alley at sundown.<br><br>Manley departed after the release of these two records, and Jackson Moore took over lead-vocal responsibilities in 1981.<br>Band members<br><br>On the records 'Remember Me'/'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' and 'Cruisin' The Streets', Cynthia Manley provided lead vocals with Robin Charin, Don Wood, Phill Manganello, Tom Morley, and Keith Stewart providing back-up vocals.<br><br>From the 1981 album Disc Charge, Jackson Moore was lead singer with Tom Morley and Bruce Carlton as back-up.<br>Discography<br>Singles<br><br>    1981: 'Remember Me'/'Ain't No Mountain High Enough'<br>    1981: 'Cruisin' The Streets'<br>    1981: 'You're The One'/'Disco Kicks'<br>    1982: 'Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You'<br>    1981: 'Come and Get Your Love'<br>    1982: 'Jump Shout'/'Rocket To Your Heart'/'Disco Kicks'<br>    1982: 'Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)'<br>    1982: 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You'/'I Just Can't Help Believing'/'Die Hard Lover'/'When Will I See You Again'<br>    1984: 'Brand New Me'/'In And Out of Love'<br>    1984: 'Dance Trance Medley'/'A Good Man (Is Hard To Find)'<br>    1984: 'Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday'/'When I Was Young'<br><br>Albums<br><br>    1981: Cruisin' The Streets<br>    1982: Disc Charge<br>    1984: A Cast Of Thousands<br></dd>
