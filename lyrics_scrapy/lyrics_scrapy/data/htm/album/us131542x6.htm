<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
A single adjective perfectly describes the powerful synergy Steve Oliver and his audiences have shared since the he first energized the contemporary jazz scene in 1999 with his hit debut First View Radiant, a word which beautifully defines the collection s uplifting spirit and celebration of music and life. With his fascinating mix of melodic guitar, driving grooves, soulful singing and infectious, seemingly extraterrestrial talents as a human drum and vocal soundscape master, Oliver while averaging from 150-200 live gigs a year throughout the U.S.--has kept the optimistic vibes rolling (and the rhythmic diversity flowing) with Positive Energy (2002) and his 2004 3-D and their radio hits High Noon and Chips and Salsa. While his previous recordings included numerous tracks featuring big productions and all-star guest artists like Harvey Mason and Eric Marienthal (who both guested on 3-D), he committed this time to a slightly scaled back approach that focuses more intimately on his guitar and voice which, his thousands of fans across the globe will tell you, has the power to create a multi-layered orchestra all its own. What I ve always loved about the radio format is that it plays what I call feel good music, and with Radiant as my working title, I had a platform and mindset that inspired me to create truly radiant music, says Oliver. You listen to it, put it on and it brings you up. Adding diversity to that feeling is important, and that s why my projects always feature a mix of vocals, pop instrumentals, jazzier tunes, Latin and R&amp;B. It s fun to mix it up, and I approached Radiant from that perspective. That s just the way I am, he adds, always trying to be as positive as possible, and trying to keep the love going. With the world the way it is, and so many things battling to drag us down, that s more important than ever now. Oliver brought back famed Spyro Gyra keyboardist Tom Schuman who co-produced 3-D--to co-produce the graceful and sensual Across the Water and the lush, inspirational closing vocal track Radiant Dreams, but on the other nine tracks sought the fresh perspective of co-producer, keyboardist and programmer Michael Broening. Broening, a founding member of the contemporary jazz band Turning Point, produced saxophonist Marion Meadows last two hit CDs and first worked with Oliver playing keys on West End, a track on First View. Like Oliver s previous albums, Radiant thrives on the thrilling sunshine of lively, playful nylon string-driven tracks like the opener (whose title says it all) Feeling Good ; Tradewinds (which begins in a dreamy, swaying mode before evolving into a funky jam); Good To Go, a Latin/world music fusion explosion featuring a sizzling, full-throttle offering of Oliver s guitar, vocalese, vocal percussion and trippy production ambience; and the brassy and bluesy, R&amp;B flavored Cool. Oliver s sensual and romantic side balances the party music via moody, atmospheric gems like Shadow of The Moon (which features Stevie Wonder s longtime trumpet player Steve Madeo), Reach The Sky and the mystical, retro-soul flavored Shine. Radiant Dreams and the deeply heartfelt vocal ballad Bend or Break show Oliver s tremendous growth over the years as an expressive pop songwriter.
