<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> The Best Of Times</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>It's been a long and lonely trip<br>But I'm glad I took it<br>Because it was well worth it<br>I got to read a couple books<br>And do some research<br>Before I reached my verdict<br><br>Never thought that I was perfect<br>Always thought that I had a purpose<br>I used to wonder if I'd live to see my first kiss<br><br>The most difficult thing that I did<br>Was recite my own words at a service<br>Realizing the person I was addressing<br>Probably wasn't looking down from heaven<br><br>Or cooking up something in hell's kitchen<br>Trying to listen in or eaves drop<br>From some another dimension<br>It was self serving just like this is<br><br>Conveniently religious on<br>Easter Sunday and on Christmas<br>The television went from being<br>A babysitter to a mistress<br><br>Technology made it easy for us to stay in touch<br>While keeping a distance<br>'til we just stayed distant and never touched<br>Now all we do is text too much<br><br>I don't remember much from my youth<br>Maybe my memory is repressed<br>Or I just spent too much time<br>Wondering if I'd live to have sex<br><br>Fell in love for the first time in 4th grade<br>But I didn't have the courage to talk to her<br>In 8th grade I wrote the note<br>And I slipped it in someone else's locker<br><br>Considered killing myself 'cause of that<br>It was a big deal, it was a blown cover<br>It was over for me, my goose was cooked<br>Stick a fork it me, the jig is up<br><br>I blew my chances, the rest is history<br>Our future was torn asunder<br>It became abundantly clear<br>I was only brought here to suffer<br><br>At least I didn't include my name<br>Thankfully I wrote the whole note in code<br>And it had 10 layers of scotch tape safety seal<br>Making it impossible to open<br><br>Plus, it was set to self destruct<br>Whoever read it probably died, laughing<br>I wonder if they lived long enough<br>To realize what happened<br><br>A year later, I came to understand<br>That wasn't love that I was feeling for her<br>I had someone else to obsess over<br>I was older, I was very mature<br><br>I forged my time signature<br>While practicing my parents autograph<br>'Cause I was failing math<br>Disconnected the phone<br>When I thought the teacher would call my home<br><br>I checked the mailbox twice a day<br>At the end of a long dirt road<br>Steamed open a couple envelopes<br>Like I was in private detective mode<br><br>If you snoop around long enough<br>For something in particular you're guaranteed to find it<br>For better or worse that's how I learned<br>That it's best to just keep some things private<br><br>It was the best of times, it was the end of times<br>It was the best of times, it was the end of times<br>It was the best of times, it was the end of times<br><br>Best of times, the end of times<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>I was always on deck, I was next in line<br>An only child with a pen and pad<br>Writing a list of things that I could never have<br><br>The walls in my house were paper thin<br>Every squabble seemed to get deafening<br>If my memory serves me correctly<br>I made it a point to void and forget some things<br><br>Probably to keep from being embarrassed<br>Never meant to upset or give grief to my parents<br>Kept my secrets, hid my talents<br>In my head, never under the mattress<br><br>Therapy couldn't break me<br>Never learned a word that would insure safety<br>So I spoke softly and I tip toed often<br>The door to my room was like a big old coffin<br><br>The way that it creaked when I closed it shut<br>Anxieties peaked when it opened up<br>As if everything that I was thinking would be exposed<br>I still sleep fully clothed<br><br>It was the best of times<br><br>It was beautiful<br>It was brutal<br>It was cruel<br>It was business as usual<br><br>Heaven, it was hell<br>Used to wonder if I'd live to see 12<br><br>When I did I figured that I was immortal<br>Loved to dance but couldn't make it to the formal<br>Couldn't bear watching my imaginary girlfriend<br>Bust a move with any other dudes<br><br>Tone Loc was talking 'bout a 'Wild Thing'<br>But I was still caught up in some child things<br>Scared of a God who couldn't spare the rod<br>It was clearly a brimstone and fire thing<br><br>Pyromaniac, kleptomaniac<br>Couldn't explain my desire to steal that fire<br>Now I add it to my rider<br>Like, 'Please, oh, please,<br>Don't throw me in that patch of brier'<br><br>It was the best of times, it was the end of times<br><br>The school counselor was clueless<br>'cause I never skipped classes<br>Perfect attendance, imperfect accent<br>Speech impediment they could never really fix<br>And I faked bad eyesight so I could wear glasses<br><br>Considered doing something that would cripple me<br>I wanted a wheelchair, I wanted the sympathy<br>I wanted straight teeth so then came braces<br>4 years of head gear helped me change faces<br><br>It was the best of times, it was the end of times<br><br>Now, I wonder if I'll live to see marriage<br>Wonder if I'll live long enough to have kids<br>Wonder if I'll live to see my kids have kids<br>If I do, gonna tell 'em how it is<br><br>Don't listen when they tell you<br>That these are your best years<br>Don't let anybody protect your ears<br>It's best that you hear what<br>They don't want you to hear<br><br>It's better to have pressure from peers<br>Than not have peers<br>Beer won't give you chest hair<br>Spicy food won't make it curl<br><br>When you think you've got it all figured out<br>And everything collapses<br>Trust me, kid, it's not the end of the world<br><br>
