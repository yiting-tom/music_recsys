<dd class="hb0">The Easybeats were an Australian rock band that formed in Sydney, Australia, in late 1964, and disbanded at the end of 1969. They were the first rock and roll act from Australia to score an international pop hit with the 1966 single 'Friday on My Mind'.<br><br>All five founding members were from families that had migrated to Australia from Europe: lead singer Stevie Wright and drummer Gordon 'Snowy' Fleet were from England; rhythm guitarist George Young was from Scotland; lead guitarist Harry Vanda and bassist Dick Diamonde were from the Netherlands.<br><br>Popular culture<br><br>In 1973 David Bowie covered 'Friday On My Mind' on his Pin Ups album, and in 1977 the punk band London introduced the song to a new generation on a four-track EP for MCA Records; the London version, produced by Simon Napier-Bell, was recorded in the same studio (IBC Studios in Portland Place) in which The Easybeats had cut the original.<br><br>A cover version of 'Good Times' by INXS and Jimmy Barnes became a #47 hit in USA after being featured on the soundtrack of the film The Lost Boys in 1987 and a #2 in Australia as well the previous year, becoming the biggest selling single on Mushroom Records.<br><br>In 1998 Australia Post issued a special edition set of twelve stamps celebrating the early years of Australian Rock ‘n’ Roll, featuring Australian hit songs of the late '50s, the '60s and the early '70s. 'Each of them said something about us, and told the rest of the world this is what popular culture sounds like, and it has an Australian accent.' One of the stamps featured was the 'She's So Fine' stamp.<br><br>Australian Rock duo Divinyls recorded a cover of 'I'll Make You Happy' on the B-side of the single 'Science Fiction' in 1982 which later appeared on the album Desperate. However, since the vocalist was a female, the lyrics 'If you don't think I'm your man, Find somebody if you can, And ask them to hold your hand, Not me.' were changed to 'If you don't wanna be my man, Pass the bottle and the empty cans, I just want to hold your hand, Just me.'<br><br>In 1982, Los Angeles California's the Three O'Clock released a version of 'Sorry' on their Baroque Hoedown EP on Frontier Records.<br><br>In 1993, New Jersey mod/power poppers the Insomniacs released a version of 'Goin' Out Of My Mind' on their German only four song EP for Outer Limits Records.<br><br>In 2011, punk rock cover band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes released a version of 'Friday On My Mind' on their Australian-themed 7', Go Down Under.<br><br>In 2012, Los Straitjackets released a version of 'Friday On My Mind' as a bonus track on their Jet Set album on Yep Roc Records.<br><br>In 2014, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band covered 'Friday On My Mind' on their tour of Australia.<br><br>In 2015, San Diego mod/power pop quintet Manual Scan released a version of 'She's So Fine' on their 10' EP, The Pyles Sessions, released in Spain.<br><br>Squeeze covered 'Friday On My Mind' during their 2016 British and U.S. tours.<br>Discography<br>Main article: The Easybeats discography<br>Studio albums<br><br>    Easy (1965)<br>    It's 2 Easy (1966)<br>    Volume 3 (1966)<br>    Good Friday / Friday On My Mind (1967) (not released in Australia)<br>    Vigil / Falling Off The Edge of the World (1968)<br>    Friends (1969)<br><br>Members<br><br>    Stevie Wright (vocals) (1964-1969, 1986)<br>    George Young (guitar) (1964-1969, 1986)<br>    Harry Vanda (guitar) (1964-1969, 1986)<br>    Dick Diamonde (bass) (1964-1969, 1986)<br>    Gordon 'Snowy' Fleet (drums) (1964-1967, 1986)<br>    Tony Cahill (drums) (1967-1969)</dd>
