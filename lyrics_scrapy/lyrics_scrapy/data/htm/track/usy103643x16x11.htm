Oh, Dinner, Right<br>So what d'ya want to do?'<br>She said 'Why don't you whip up somethin in the kitchen?'<br>'Yeah,' I said, 'Why don't you?'<br><br>And then she said 'Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?'<br>I says 'No'<br>She says 'Yes'<br>I says 'No'<br>She says 'Yes'<br>I says 'No'<br>She says 'Yes...<br>...Oh, here's your keys'<br><br>I step a little bit closer<br>Say 'OK, where ya want to go?'<br>She says 'How about The Ivy?'<br>I said 'Yeah, well I don't know...'<br><br>I don't feel like gettin all dressed up<br>And eatin' expensive food<br>She's says 'Olive Garden?'<br>I say 'Nah, I'm not in the mood...<br><br>...And Burrito King would make me gassy<br>There's no doubt'<br>She says 'Just forget about it'<br>I said 'No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!'<br><br>Then I get an idea<br>I says 'I know what we'll do!'<br>She says 'What?'<br>I say 'Guess'<br>She says 'What?'<br>I say 'We're goin' to the drive-thru!'<br><br>So we head out the front door<br>Open the garage door<br>Then I open the car doors<br>And we get in those car doors<br><br>Put my key in the ignition<br>And then I turn it sideways<br>Then we fasten our seat belts<br>As we pull out the driveway<br><br>Then we drive to the drive-thru<br>Heading off to the drive-thru<br>We're approaching the drive-thru<br>Getting close to the drive-thru!<br><br>Almost there at the drive-thru<br>Now we're here at the drive thru<br>Here in line at the drive-thru<br>Did I mention the drive-thru?<br><br>Well here we are<br>In the drive-thru line, me and her.<br>Cars in front of us, cars in back of us.<br>All just waiting to order<br><br>There's some idiot in a Volvo<br>With his brights on behind me<br>I lean out the window and scream<br>'Hey, Whatcha tryin to do, blind me?'<br><br>My wife says 'Maybe we should park...<br>...We could just go eat inside.'<br>I said 'I'm wearin' bunny slippers<br>So I ain't leavin' this ride...'<br><br>Now a woman on a speaker box<br>Is sayin' 'Can I take your order, please?'<br>I said 'Yes indeed, you certainly can<br>We'd like two hamburgers with onions and cheese.'<br><br>Then my wife says<br>'Baby, hold on, I've changed my mind!<br>I think I'm gonna have a chicken sandwich<br>Instead, this time'<br><br>I said 'You always get a cheeseburger!'<br>She says 'That's not what I'm hungry for.'<br>I put my head in my hands and screamed,<br>'I don't know who you are anymore!'<br><br>The voice on the speaker says<br>'I don't have all day!'<br>I said 'Then, take our order,<br>And we'll be on our way!<br><br>I wanna get a chicken sandwich<br>And I want a cheeseburger, too<br>She's like 'You want onions on that?'<br>I'm like 'Yeah, I already said that I do...<br><br>...Plus we need curly fries<br>And don't you dare forget it!<br>And two medium root beers<br>No, just one, we'll split it.'<br><br>Then I said 'I'm guessin' that<br>You're probably not too bright...<br>So read me back my order<br>Let's make sure you got it right.'<br><br>She says 'One, you want a chicken sandwich.<br>Two, you want a cheeseburger<br>Three, curly fries, and a large root beer'<br>'Stop, don't go no further!'<br><br>'I never ordered a large rootbeer<br>I said medium, not large!'<br>Then she says 'We're havin' a special,<br>I supersized you at no charge.'<br><br>'Oh.' And that's all<br>I could say, was 'Oh.'<br>And she says 'Now there is somethin' else<br>That I really think you should know.<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br><br>You can have unlimited refills<br>For just a quarter more...'<br>I say 'Great, except we're in the drive thru...<br>So what would I want that for?'<br><br>Then she says 'Wait a minute<br>Your voice sounds so familiar...hey, is this Paul?<br>And my wife is all like 'No, that ain't Paul,<br>Now tell me, who's this Paul?<br><br>She says 'Oh, he's just some guy<br>Who goes to school with me.<br>I sat behind him last year<br>And I copied off him in Geometry.<br>I said 'I know a guy named Paul.<br>He used to be my plumber<br>He was prematurely bald<br>And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer.<br><br>He also had bladder problems<br>And a really bad infection on his toe.'<br>And she said 'Mister, please, you can stop right there,<br>That's way more than I needed to know!'<br><br>And then we both were quiet<br>And things got real intense<br>Then she says 'Next window please,<br>That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents.'<br><br>So we inched ahead in line<br>Movin' painfully slow<br>I got a little bored<br>So I turned on the radio...<br><br><br>Turned it off<br>Because my wife was getting a headache<br>So we both just sat there quietly<br>For her sake.<br><br>Then I looked at her<br>And she looked back at me<br>And I said 'Um,<br>I think you have somethin' in your teeth.'<br><br>She turned away from me<br>And then turned back and said 'Did I get it?'<br>I said 'Yeah. Well, I mean, most of it...<br>But hey, ya know, don't sweat it.'<br><br>Then she said 'How about now?'<br>I said 'Yeah, almost.<br>There's still a little bit there<br>But don't worry, it's probably just a piece of toast.'<br><br>Now we're at the pay window<br>Or whatever you call it<br>Put my hand in my pocket<br>I can't believe there's no wallet!<br><br>And the lady at the window's like,<br>'Well, well that'll be five eighty two.'<br>I turn around to my wife, and say<br>'How much have you got on you?'<br><br>She just rolls her eyes and says<br>'I'll pay for this, I guess.'<br>So she reaches into her purse<br>And pulls out the American Express<br><br>I hand it to the lady<br>And she says 'Oh, dear.<br>It's gotta be cash only<br>We don't take credit cards here.'<br><br>I took back the card and said<br>'Gee, really? Well that sucks.'<br>And that's when I found out<br>My wife was only carryin' three bucks.<br><br>I said 'I thought you were<br>Going to hit the ATM today'<br>She says 'I never got around to it<br>So where's your wallet anyway?<br><br>And I said 'Nevermind,<br>Just help me to find some change...'<br>Now the lady at the window<br>Is lookin at me kinda strange...<br><br>And she says 'Mister, please,<br>We gotta move this line along'<br>I said 'Now hold your stinkin' horses lady,<br>We won't be long.'<br><br>We looked around inside the glove-box<br>And check the mat beneath my feet<br>I found a nickel in the ashtray<br>And a couple pennies and a dime in the space betweent he seats<br><br>Before long I had a little pile<br>Of coins of every sort<br>The lady counts it up and says<br>'You're still about a dollar short'<br><br>And now my woman's got this weird look<br>Frozen on her face<br>She screams, 'you know<br>I wasn't even really hungry in the first place'<br><br>And so I turned around<br>To the cashier again<br>I shrugged and said 'OK<br>Forget the chicken sandwich then'<br><br>So I pick up my change<br>Pick up my reciept<br>And I drive to the pickup window<br>Man, I just can't wait to eat<br><br>And now we see this acne ridden<br>Kid about sixteen<br>Wearin' a dorky nametag that says<br>'Hello, my name is Eugene.'<br><br>And he hands me a paper bag<br>I look him in the eyes<br>And I say to him 'Hey, Eugene,<br>Can I get some ketchup for my fries?'<br><br>Well he looks at me<br>And I look at him<br>And he looks at me<br>And I look at him<br><br>And he looks at me<br>And I look at him<br>And he says 'I'm sorry<br>What did you want again?'<br><br>I say 'Ketchup!'<br>And he says 'Oh yeah, that's right...<br>...I just spaced out there for a second<br>I'm really kind of burnt tonight.'<br><br>And then he hands me the ketchup<br>And now we're finally drivin' away<br>And the food is drivin' me mad<br>With its intoxicating bouquet<br><br>I'm starvin' to death<br>By the time we pull up at the traffic light<br>I say 'Baby, gimme that burger,<br>I just gotta have a bite!'<br><br>So she reaches in the bag<br>And pulls out the burger<br>And she hands me the burger<br>And I pick up the burger<br><br>And then I unwrap the paper<br>I bite into those buns<br>And I just can't believe it<br>They forgot the onions!<br><br>Turned it off<br><br>
