<br>
Want to know how to turn dreams into reality? Pay close attention to Miami Dade rap cartel Triple C's. In 1997 two aspiring rappers from Miami's Carol City--Rick Ross and Gunplay--joined forces with the common goal to use rap music to attract the baddest women, purchase the finest clothes and own a few custom cars and cycles. The plan was simple: stick to the core principles of hip hop; spit hot rhymes over dope beats and make music that appeals to the streets. If everything went accordingly, the boss (Ross) and his loyal lieutenant (Gunplay) would soon be able to cruise down South Beach with their Chevy's riding high--just like they dreamed.<br><br>A year later, Ross and Gunplay invited a brash Bronx rapper to join their team. Torch, who moved down south after battling legal issues in New York, was a likeminded lyricist that shared Triple C's objective. Though Torch initially balked at the invitation, the trio's undeniable chemistry in the studio convinced him otherwise. A string of local hits put the group further down their path to success, but Ross started to think bigger. The stays in cheap motels and $5 meals weren't cutting it. The Boss had to take charge--of the charts. He inked a solo deal with Miami's Slip-N-Slide Records and stormed the Billboard charts in 2005 with the breakout single 'Hustlin'.' It was the springboard the group was looking for, their frontman blossoming into a rap superstar, as the rest of the crew rode shotgun with the ultimate goal in sight.<br><br>By the time Ross delivered his second #1 album, Trilla, in 2007 Triple C's were living their dream. The women were stunning, the hotels were 5-Star, and the cars were foreign. Most importantly they had the respect of the streets. Ross' potent wordplay and overarching realness resonated and his associates could be trusted to do the same when called upon. Gunplay and Torch displayed their contrasting styles on Trilla's 'Reppin' My City.'<br><br>In 2009 Ross released his third straight #1 album, Deeper Than Rap through a joint venture on Maybach Music Group/Def Jam. The deal put in motion plans to deliver the long awaited Triple C's album. And just like they planned a decade ago the group would go back to the basics. Craft streetcertified joints from hot rhymes and dope beats. Even the title would show appreciation for the Triple C's original mission statement, Custom Cars &amp; Cycles. <br><br>1.
