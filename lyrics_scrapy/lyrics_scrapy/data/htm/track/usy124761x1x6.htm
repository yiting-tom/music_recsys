<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> The Devil's Contract</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>I left my stress, the need to make amends in the corner, I torture the ones that I knew, I stayed alone cus I was rotting on the inside, I planned this out so they won't think it was a suicide, you were right, you were all right, there is a god but he isn't on my side, they will never know what went wrong, they're better off thinking I died strong, I was sold as a slave, the demons dug their nails and my debts not paid, I've given up on sleeping, I'm done repeating the same day over and over I think I'm losing it, they were right they were all right, there is a god but he watches as my soul dies, I don't need a fucking savior, sold my sold, don't you believe me? Sold my soul, they won't forget me, sold my soul to hell, don't you believe me? They think they know but they don't know, they'll never know, told my family and friends just to forget me, they think ! there's hope but there's no hope, they've gotta know, I fought these thoughts cus I knew they were destroying me, I struck blood from an undeserving enemy, you were right you were all right, there is a hell but it's waiting for the right time, they will never know what went wrong, they're better off thinking I died strong, they will claw, they will bite, they will keep me, I will cut, I will stab just release me, the man that you knew sends regards from the grave, says he's gone but not dead, but there's no one to save, no one, I am here to do your work, so just release me, because I sold my soul to hell, don't you believe me? They think they know but they don't know, they'll never know, told my family and friends just to forget me, they think there's hope but there's no hope, they've gotta know, there's no fucking hope.<br><br>
