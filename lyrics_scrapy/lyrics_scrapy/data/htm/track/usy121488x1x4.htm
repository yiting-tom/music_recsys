<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> You Can't Be Neutral On a Moving Train</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>[Intro]Howard Zinn - Governments lie all the time. Well not just the American government, it's just, in the naturer of governments. Well they have to lie. And since they all represent the people, in some sense they act against the interest of the people, the only way they can hold power, is if they lie to the people.<br><br>[Unknown]You don't know what I know, you can't see the spreading stain, of deception. I am cruel to myself, things will never be...The same. [Howard Zinn]- If they told people the truth they wouldn't last very long. -<br><br>[Unknown]I will hold my silence, like a weapon, in my hand. If I used it, I would murder myself.. You could never understand.<br><br>[Vinnie Paz : Verse 1]<br><br>Columbus came ashore greeted with nothin but niceness, sailin West in attempt to find gold and spices. Dominated by the popes in frenzy for ices, the Catholic church expelled Jew's and claimed it was righteous. The first man to see land would get a reward, and get a yearly pension for life, clearly from God. A young sailor saw land said, ' we isn't far, ' Columbus lied said he saw it the evening before. They touched ground they were greeted by the Arawak, Columbus had them locked up as prisoners in an hour flat. He wanted to find they source of gold and that was that, and when they thought that wasn't fair then he stabbed their backs. When there was no more gold, he took slaves instead. And left a quarter-million Indians in Haiti dead. The men died in mines, the women died at work, the children died from lack of milk and they died in the dirt. They were just takin advantage of a passive people, they were just bein the savages of massive evil, that's the church work that's th! e path of massive ego, that's the blood of Abraham bein stabbed by the steeple. In 1619 they were patiently waitin' for a ship that carried slaves that was changin' a nation, the white man was a cannibal prayin' to Satan. Hatred contempt the pity of patronazation. That's the cornerstone, everything racism based in, the African had a more advanced civilization. Black was slave, master was white, rationalization, 50-million dead, that's Western civilization. At first they appeared in the North, and they were helpless in the face of superior force, and all of them were chained together they really was lost. Racism isn't natural it's merely divorced. Before the slave-trade black was considered distasteful. By the Oxford Dictionary I find it disgraceful. It's not a natural tendency to be bitter and hateful, it's a natural enemy of the critical staple. Slavery grew as the plantation system grew, the reason for thats kinda easily tracible. Society of a good health was capable, or ! sayin, ' Fuck a slave master! You're in slavery too! ' 7 slave! s were p ut to death for murderin' master, fear of slave revolt had them developing faster, you a cataline killer inelequent bastard, I would burn the white man while smellin' the ashes. From time to time white man was part of the resistence, white indigenous servants wanted no part of the system. King Phillip's war showed that if people would listen, that we could maybe break the complex chains of opression. Tyranny is tyranny but that's a concesssion, but the women they were treated like that of possesions. Black women had to work cuz they was abbused, that's the white justification of Arayan Blues. The next move was to dominate the Mexicans, James Polk dominated them like they was next of kin. He sent Colonel Cross to lie to them and let them in, 11 days later his skull was crushed, so message sent! We take nothin' by conquest that was the mantra, the military wasn't human they was just monsters. Henry David Thoreau refused to pay his taxes, denounced the Mexican war and got locke! d in shackles! The 20th century open anger re-emerged. Reality of ordinary life was bein heard. Anarchists and feminists came from factory-work, Communism, Socialism seemed to be re-birthed. War is the health of the state is what Bourne said, and if you was born around that time you was born dead. The espionage act had people confused, cuz it was double-talk and they ain't know how it be used, supposedly it was an act against spyin, you boys know that, that was bullshit, and they was lyin! Charles Schenk was arrested in Philadelphia for printin' and distributin' leaflets cuz they was helpin' ya. He was indited, tried and then found guilty, and spent 6 months in jail don't that sound silly? Had his freedom taken away by his own nation, but there's a lesson do not submit to intimidation. The act still exists today and this shit is real, supposedly Kennedy tried to have that shit appealed. Eugene Debs did 10 years for no purpose, he obstructed the recruiting and en-listment se! rvice. The post office started takin' mail privaleges, of maga! zines wh o printed anti-war sentiments. A Socialist named Fairchild had it right, he said that, ' They can shoot me, but they can't make me fight! ' They sentenced him to a year in jail and that was reckless, 65 thousand men, consciencous objectors. They were sent to army bases to work their, they were treated sadistically and were hurt their. They were strangled with a hemp rope till they colapsed, and officers punched they stomachs and they lower backs. A garden hose was placed on they face with a nozzle, about 6'' inches from them so they couldn't swallow. The war ended in 1918, the government was just tryin' to wipe the slate clean. Hemmingway wrote ' Fairwell to Arms ' Dalton Trumbo wrote ' Johnny Got His Gun. ' The war was over but they didn't learn they lesson, twin-tactis of control, reform and repression. The patriotic fervor of war had been invoked.. That's why the country that you live in is a fucking joke!<br><br>[Outro : Vinnie Paz]<br><br>You can not be neutral on a moving train.<br>This is a story about the lies that your teacher told ya.<br>This is real actual factual.<br>No lies on the whole record, if you don't believe me look it up.<br>I'm tryna share the shit that I learned.... With y'all!<br>Do the knowledge.<br>Your government does not care about you.<br>The people in power do not care about you.<br>Understand that.<br>Power to the people!!!!!<br><br>(Howard Zinn)<br><br>War is like, a fix. Ya know you get high on war, we won we won! And then your, your down on the ground, and ya need another fix, ya need another war. Why do you think weve had war after war after war after war. Every war ya know, they say this is the end, this is the last war. In World War 1.. They said, this is the war to end all wars.. And then not long after that was World War 2, and then soon the United States was waging war in Korea, then Vietnam. If you study history what you learn is that, wars are always accompanied by lies... Wars are always accompanied by deception.....<br><br>
