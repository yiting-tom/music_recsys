<dd class="hb0">Brotherhood of Man are a British pop group who achieved success in the 1970s. They won the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest with 'Save Your Kisses for Me'.<br><br>Created in 1969 by songwriter and record producer Tony Hiller, Brotherhood of Man was initially an umbrella title for a frequently-changing line-up of session singers. Early on, they scored a worldwide hit with the song 'United We Stand'. By 1973 the concept had run its course and Hiller formed a definite four-member line-up consisting of Martin Lee, Lee Sheriden, Nicky Stevens and Sandra Stevens. This version of the group went on to score many hits around the world in the mid to late 1970s including 'Kiss Me Kiss Your Baby', 'Angelo', 'Oh Boy (The Mood I'm In)' and 'Figaro'. They achieved perhaps their biggest success in their native UK with three number one singles and four top twenty albums. The group under this line-up still continues, performing shows throughout Europe. Altogether, they have released 16 studio albums, with worldwide sales topping 15 million records.<br><br>Members<br><br>Brotherhood of Man I (1969–1972)<br><br>    John Goodison (1969–71)<br>    Tony Burrows (1969–70)<br>    Roger Greenaway (1969–71)<br>    Sue Glover (1969–72)<br>    Sunny Leslie (1969–72)<br>    Hal Atkinson (1971–72)<br>    Russell Stone (1971–72)<br><br>Brotherhood of Man II (1972–present)<br><br>    Martin Lee (1972–present)<br>    Lee Sheriden (1972–81, 1986–present)<br>    Nicky Stevens (1972–present)<br>    Sandra Stevens (1973–present)<br>    Barry Upton (1982–84)<br><br>Discography<br><br>    United We Stand (Deram, 1970)<br>    We're the Brotherhood of Man (Deram, 1972)<br>    The World of the Brotherhood of Man (Decca, 1973)<br>    Good Things Happening (Dawn, 1974)<br>    Love and Kisses (Pye, 1976)<br>    Oh Boy!
