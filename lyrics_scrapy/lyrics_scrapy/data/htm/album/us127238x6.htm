<br>
<br>
Traffic was one of the premier architects of the acid rock movement in the sixties and blossomed further into one of<br>the most important super groups of the seventies. Their recordings are the soundtrack to a generation of music<br>stand the test of time.<br>In 1974, the legendary founding members Stevie Winwood, Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood sojourned on after smash<br>outings with The Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys (FRM 9180) and continued the winning streak with their final<br>seventies studio classic When The Eagle Flies. Along with new member Roscoe Gee on bass, the legendary<br>Traffic was truly rewarding their fans worldwide with this solid swansong, after a decade of brilliant progressive<br>rock recordings which would forever define the genre.<br>Known for its famous Martin Hughes illustrated cover, the multi-faceted music inside was a non-stop enjoyment of<br>sounds harkening back not only to their 1968 Traffic album (FRM 9081) but also a look to the future with a more<br>organic prog rock/jazz approach, which would further define their genius in the studio setting. Whether standout<br>tracks like the rocking opener Something New or the jam fused sounds with the classic Graveyard People, this<br>brilliant album will most certainly be known forever for its classic hit track Walking In The Wind and the massive<br>eleven minute plus epic, Dream Gerrad. Filled with explosive sax breaks by the late Chris Wood, the piano driven<br>and vocal delivery of master musician legend Stevie Winwood and the percussive vibrations of the late great Jim<br>Capaldi, When The Eagle Flies was destined to become a huge success.<br>Even further classics ensued with each of the lengthy seven tracks that make up this arresting masterwork.....how<br>about the reflective classic Memories of A Rock N Rolla or the Winwood/Capaldi title track classic When The<br>Eagle Flies. No matter where you go with this album, it s all about Traffic, classic Traffic, and it just doesn t get<br>much better than this.<br>It is now with much anticipation and honor to announce the Traffic/Friday Music 180 Gram Audiophile Vinyl Series<br>as we begin with our third installment with their final album of the classic rock era When The Eagle Flies.<br>Mastered impeccably by Joe Reagoso at Friday Music Studios, When The Eagle Flies is truly one of the most important audiophile vinyl releases of this year!<br>To make this an even more enjoyable limited edition happening, for a very short time, we are also going back to<br>the original album designed graphics, creating a special first time gatefold cover, which also included more artwork<br>and lyrics not seen in the LP format since its 1974 release!<br>Look to the Friday Music label for more Traffic masterpieces on 180 Gram Audiophile Vinyl in the very near future.<br>Welcome back Traffic....When The Eagle Flies...
