And ain't no telling what his mood will b, he been having struggles ever since he entered puberty. Look n his face ain't a glow n his eyes, he so quiet that u wouldn't even kno he arrived. They say he shy and he won't even go and say hi, he play the background he feel like they don't kno he alive. Feeling so insignificant so friendships he limit em, and he aim to keep his conversations to a minimum. He think he's okward inside he feels weird, so when he's around his peers he don't think nobody feeling him. And even worse he hate the circle he sit in, so u can see him tryna act different he tryna fit in. With all the cool club attendees i hope he get in, he should cut the act like bad weaves and split ins. But he wish he was a little bit taller he wish he was a baller, he wish he had a girl he could call. A click and a car to get attention at the mall, and a closet full of gear to help him cover up his flaws.<br><br>hook：<br><br><br>You are, formed by the same hands who made the stars. Fashioned by the Creator, perfectly designed and tailored. You are tailor made.<br><br>She size up her chest then she look at her behind, she feel she look a mess and its messing with her mind. It's making her depressed thinking bout it all the time, cause she feels like she's a four and she wanna be a dime, dang. Made n God's image it's a crying, shame, that she don't see the devil playing mind, games. And envy is a mountain that's impossible to climb, she do so what she feeling all the time?, pain. And she just wanna erase that, it's like a prison and she just wanna escape that. But God has given her sumthn He'll never take back, shaped for His glory with perfect beauty you're in Him and denim aint how u rate that. Listen, your value is to be embrace, a meek and gentle spirit is the beauty u should chase. God is satisfied with the vessel that He shaped, He care less about your size and the make up on ya face.<br><br><br>hook:<br><br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br><br>You are, formed by the same hands who made the stars. Fashioned by the Creator, perfectly designed and tailored. You are tailor made.<br><br><br><br><br>I hope u hear me this is true stuff, it's no lie, i swear it aint. But u were Taylor made like a tutux, I'm talking customized like a new truck. With a fresh paint job and sum chrome wheels, plush insides and the motor all juiced up. And yea u cost Him more than a few bucks, when His Son hung like a noose from the klu klux. So y u live with all this pressure, so thirsty 4 validation don't even kno u special. U feel like u r lesser, like pennies on ya dresser, but before u was a baby u were made 2 b His vessel. Rare and unique image bearer of peace, and God decided 2 dwell n u like His personal man cave. He made many men but only 1 u so u truly give meaning 2 being hand made.<br><br>hook:<br><br><br>You are, formed by the same hands who made the stars. Fashioned by the Creator, perfectly designed and tailored. You are tailor made.<br><br>
