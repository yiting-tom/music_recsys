<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> A Century Of Elvis</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>We were sitting in the living room on the sofa,<br>the wrong way round, looking out the window.<br>It was quiet, and then in the car park across the road<br>we saw Elvis - look, there beside the postman's van,<br>and he was walking round the postman's van,<br>looking in the open door.<br><br>He looked as if he was thinking about getting in,<br>but then the postman came back,<br>and he swaggered off,<br>walked past the window and down the stairs,<br>and then at the bottom of the stairs right<br>by the caretaker's office,<br>he started licking the pavement.<br><br>Every night now since we moved in that new house<br>there's this noise outside the door at just about half seven<br>or eight o' clock every night.<br><br>And if we go and look outside the door,<br>Elvis'll be standing there waiting to be let in.<br>And then he wanders into the living room,<br>maybe sits down on one of the chairs<br>or even lies down on the floor.<br><br>He doesn't say much,<br>he just stays there for an hour or two, watching the TV.<br>We talk to him a bit,<br>and then around ten o' clock, he'll go away again,<br>and not come back until the next night.<br><br>There's a lot of lanes and stuff around here,<br>around the house - although it's right in the middle<br>of the city it seems quite like the country,<br>it's dead hidden - safe I suppose, made for night living.<br>There's a lot of squirrels and birds,<br>and Stuart says he's seen about nine foxes<br>there when he's jumped over the fence on<br>his way to Prior's Road.<br><br>Sometimes you can go out walking,<br>and when you've been out for a wee while even you don't know<br>where you are anymore,<br>so it would be pretty hard for anyone else to find you.<br>I suppose that's why he spends so much time there,<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>that's why he's come to live there, or maybe it's<br>just the squirrels.<br>I read about somewhere that he likes squirrels quite a lot.<br>There's these two videos that we got for wedding presents -<br>called the e-files, e-files one and e-files two about how Elvis is<br>supposed to be still alive.<br><br>And one time when he came round we were watching one of<br>those, but he didn't say anything he just sat on the armchair.<br>He was playing with his collar a bit, and we watched<br>it right through and then when it finished he just<br>got up and walked off into the mist and didn't say anything.<br>the first few times he came round I didn't speak to him at all,<br>I wasn't really sure what to say.<br>And Karen spoke to him quite a lot -<br>she seemed to know what to do more than I do.<br>He had quite a strange manner though,<br>he'd go into your stuff and look through it, then he'd maybe<br>pick something up and play with it for a wee while,<br>but he'd never make any comment about any of it.<br>Seemed pretty rude to me. I just watched whatever Karen did,<br>and listened to how she talked to him and then,<br>after a while I started to copy that, and tell him a few things,<br>not really bothered about whether he<br>responded or said anything back or not. I think the first time<br>I spoke to him we were sitting up on the mezzanine and<br>I said that I would tell him about me and wee Karen,<br>and how it was that we'd come to be living there.<br>I thought he probably liked the fact that we were<br>living there because he came round so much, so<br>I thought he might want to know how it was that it came about.<br>We did it all over backwards, I told him.<br>First of all we got to know each other,<br>and then a while after that we met,<br>and when we'd known each other for<br>about seven years we decided to have an anniversary,<br>and that went quite well,<br>so after the anniversary we had a honeymoon,<br>and that went well too,<br>so after that we decided that we would get married.<br>That's why we're living there now.<br>I used to think my dad was<br>Elvis, but I haven't told him that yet. I haven't told my dad either...<br><br>
