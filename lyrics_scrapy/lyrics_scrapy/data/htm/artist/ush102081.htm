<dd class="hb0">Mayra Caról Ambriz Quintana (born May 21, 1986 in Los Angeles, California)—better known under the mononym, Myra is an American singer, dancer and choreographer of Mexican descent. She is the first Latina artist to have been signed to Hollywood Records, Walt Disney Records, and Avex Trax. She is best known for her 2001 singles, 'Dancing in the Street' for Recess: School's Out and 'Miracles Happen (When You Believe)' for the film The Princess Diaries.<br><br><br>Career<br><br>Myra's first album released was the Mariachi album Mensajera del Amór, released by Briaz Promotions in 1997. At the time of its release, Myra was then known as Mayra Caról.<br><br>Myra rose to prominence in 2001 after being signed to Hollywood Records and recording a cover of Martha and the Vandellas's 'Dancing in the Street' for the soundtrack to the 2001 film Recess: School's Out. The song was the first single released from her self-titled album Myra which was released on June 8, 2001. The second single from the album, 'Miracles Happen (When You Believe)' was also featured in the film The Princess Diaries, and received a 2002 ALMA Award nomination for Outstanding Song in a Motion Picture Soundtrack. A re-recorded Spanish version of the album titled Milagros was released on October 16, 2001.<br><br>In October 2001, Myra made an appearance in the film Max Keeble's Big Move as Chelsea, Max Keeble's (Alex D. Linz) love interest. During this time, she toured with Aaron Carter, opening for his 2000-2001 'Party' Tour.' She was also a featured artist during the Radio Disney Live! 2001 World Tour.<br><br>In 2007, Myra was featured on the single, 'Back To You' by Chicano Rapper, Veze Skante that was included on the compilation album, La Costa Nuestra. The single saw commercial success within the Chicano community and was accompanied by a music video which was heavily rotated on MTV Tr3s's Mi TRL. The following year, Myra was featured as a guest artist on another Chicano Rapper, Mal Hablado. The single saw no commercial success.<br><br>In October 2016, Myra was the headlining musical guest for Modesto's Annual Pride in the Park Festival in Modesto, CA, and re-visited the town in December for a Christmas special at Urbano California Bistro &amp; Nightclub accompanied by Mexican singer, Ivan Calvillo and hosted by David Soria (as his drag persona, Sasha Devaroe) to benefit and raise awareness for the Modesto-based Fallen Angels Guidance Foundation, which helps displaced and homeless LGBT youths. Along with Christmas classics, Myra sang cover songs by the late Tejano singer, Selena Quintanilla and Regional Mexican singer Jenni Rivera. She also sang a beautiful rendition of Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' from the film, The Bodyguard.<br><br>On January 18. 2018, Myra was a guest on local bi-lingual radio podcast located in Calistoga, CA called KBBF Radio: Lideres del Futuro where she spoke to the radio hosts about how she was discovered, and still experiencing poverty even though she was touring around the world with Aaron Carter and Radio Disney and presented with all types of 'amazing opportunities.' Although both of her parents noticed her talented singing abilities that led to her father being 100% supportive and on board to sign with Disney Records, her mother voiced her concerns about wanting her to complete her education and become a nurse. She spoke on how she took some time off to raise her daughter Jadah as a single mother, and where her career will be heading in the near future.</dd>
