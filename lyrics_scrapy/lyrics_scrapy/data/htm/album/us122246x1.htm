<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
Saxman and vocalist Terry Hanck was born in Chicago and first made a name for himself playing with Elvin Bishop in the 1970s. He can be heard blowing sax on Bishop's big hit Fooled Around and Fell in Love. He currently lives on the West Coast and often gigs in Florida, too. I saw him perform at The Back Room in Boca Raton a few years back and he blew me away. Terry is the coolest cat in the room. He has put out a number of excellent self-produced CDs over the last few years. This new one, his first major label release, is the best CD I have heard all year. The record cover says 'Greasy Soul Rockin' Blues' and that sums up how Terry plays. He is a fine vocalist and demonstrates his skills on some slow ballads. Guitarist 'Kid' Andersen played on and produced this CD, which contains some nice originals and obscure covers. If there is justice in the music world, Terry will finally hit it big. --Scott 'Hambone' Hammer, ChicagoBluesGuide.com<br><br>The cover of this disc states 'Greasy Soul Rockin' Blues' and for once, there is truth in the advertising.<br><br>This is the kind of stuff that the King Record label was built on - the kind of records you used to hear all day long in the 1950's to early 1960's. It's not surprising that Terry Hanck grew up listening to the hot R&amp;B and blues songs of the time. What is surprising is that the the 66 year-old Hanck is playing and singing with energy level of musicians several decades younger. His brawny tenor sax calls out like a voice in the wilderness, one minute soothing your soul and the next beckoning you to the dance floor. Equally impressive is his singing throughout the disc. Hanck manages to change his tone enough on several tracks that you might think someone else is handling the lead vocal. What is consistent is verve and zeal that Hanck infuses in every performance on the album.<br><br>This one is a party from start to finish. The joy and passion that Hanck brings to this project will win you over. When you add in the outstanding contributions of his band and guest musicians, it is easy to see why I include Look Out! among the handful of exceptional recordings I have heard so far this year. It may be old school but it sure sounds good !!!! --Mark Thompson, President of the Crossroads Blues Society in Rockford, IL<br><br>Oh my goodness! Just a little past half way through 2011 and we have the lead contender for album of the year. Terry Hanck has put his very best on this recording, and that's saying a lot.<br><br>From Hanck's love for vintage blues and R&amp;B, evident on almost every track, to his superb and serious saxophone chops, to his crack band and his song selection, there's not a track of filler on the album. But there is something intrinsically fresh to his sound as well. For a 66-year old cat, he sure plays like an unbridled and fearless youth.<br><br>Hanck's tenor, as usual gets a whole lot of airtime on this one, just listen to Keep A Drivin' or Ain't That Just Like a Woman or, pretty much any track on the CD. His fiery reed work, beautiful tone and effortless, inventive melodies make for a thoroughly enjoyable 62-minutes of listening. (He's Elvin Bishop's favorite sax player too!)<br><br>Hanck's voice is a marvel. He can make it growl, ache, croon, moan and tease, and then some. It is a superb instrument in its own right. Listen to I Keep Holding On and tell me I'm wrong.<br><br>I also can't say enough about the emergence of Johnny 'Cat' Soubrand as a lead guitarist of originality, fire and consummate grace. He proves here he is among the emerging great ones. With phrasing, tone and string-bending to burn, his contributions alone are well worth hearing. Check out, You Coulda Let Me Go or his take on the Freddie King/Sonny Thompson instrumental, Side Tracked.<br><br>The genius of Chris 'Kid' Anderson who co-produced the sessions (along with Hanck) is astounding. He recorded, engineered and mastered the album beautifully. As a former member of Terry's band, he has an instinctive feel for what works and how not to push the band into anything less than their utmost. He even contributes a wonderful (and playful) guitar solo on Hanck's original Appreciate What You Got. Add to that his all-over-the-place contributions on rhythm guitar, keys, bass and vocals and you've got a consummate musician.<br><br>Hanck wrote or co-wrote five of the 13-cuts on the CD, and they show his musicianship isn't limited to stage-presence and playing alone. His crack band of drummer Butch Cousins, bassist Tim Wagar hold down the rhythm with finesse and provide a free-and-easy background bottom for the stars to shine. The ever-great Bob Welsh on keyboards just smokes, and Lorenzo Farrel on bass and organ is a fine addition to the mix.<br><br>This is a multiple-listening CD; a turn-it-up in your car CD; a have-a-party CD and just about anything else you can think of. If you've not hipped yourself to Terry Hanck and his band, this is a superb place to start. --Joseph Jordan , Golden Gate Blues Society Newsletter, July 2011
