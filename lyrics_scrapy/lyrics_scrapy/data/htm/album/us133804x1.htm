<br>
<br>
Ring Of Fire's story begins in the year 2000. Having completed a successful mini-tour with Yngwie Malmsteen in late 1999 on the heels of the 'Alchemy' album, vocalist Mark Boals set about creating his second solo album, a collection of songs very neo-classical in their nature. When deciding on a line-up for the album, Tony MacAlpine came highly recommended and Tony in turn recommended Virgil Donati (Planet X) on drums. The impressive line-up was rounded out by classically-trained Artension keyboardist Vitalij Kuprij, with Boals and MacAlpine splitting bass duties.<br><br>Combining melodic metal songs with fantasy-based lyrics, topped off with virtuoso performances from the line-up, the resulting RING OF FIRE albums proved to be exactly what many neoclassical-metal fans had waited for, creating a solid fan base for the band all over the world.<br><br>'Battle of Leningrad' is the band's fourth studio album, coming after a 9 years hiatus a period which has seen the band members getting involved in other projects, most notably with singer Mark Boals becoming singer for Royal Hunt and Kuprij and MacAlpine touring with Trans Siberian Orchestra and Steve Vai respectively.<br><br>Ring of Fire reconvened with Boals, MacAlpine and Kurprij during 2012, when they agreed to work on their unfinished business and develop a new album from the true story of the siege of Leningrad during the WWII.<br><br>Mark Boals explains: 'It is a true story of the strength and resilience of the Russian people throughout history and particularly in this instance of 900 days of being surrounded on all sides with no food and no hope of rescue, under siege of the Nazi army. The magnificent city of Leningrad with millions of people trapped, found a way to withstand the daily attacks of rockets and bombs, the lack of food, water, and fuel for heat. Although more than 1 million starved to death, most survived, and the Nazis were never able to overtake the city completely. They were finally forced to retreat by the Russian army. Not widely known by most, this was an amazing story and one of World War II's finest examples of heroism in the worst circumstances imaginable'.<br><br>Musically the album is all the fans have been waiting for. True 'Neoclassic' Power Metal with technical and exciting musical passages which promise to reignite the RING OF FIRE flame among the fans!<br><br>Timo Tolkki (ex Stratovarius) mixed the album and played bass with Jani Huovinen playing drums.
