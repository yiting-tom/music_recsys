Alesso is managed by Shots Studios.<br><br>He has worked with numerous artists, including Tove Lo, Theo Hutchcraft, Ryan Tedder, Calvin Harris, Usher, David Guetta and Sebastian Ingrosso. He has also performed at numerous music festivals, including Coachella, Electric Daisy Carnival, Creamfields, and Tomorrowland. In 2012, MTV named Alesso one of the 'EDM Rookies to Watch', and Madonna, who invited him to open select dates on her MDNA Tour, called Alesso 'the next big thing in dance music.' He was ranked 13th on DJ Magazine's 2015 list of the top 100 DJs and number 20th in year 2016 on DjMag, A DJ Website, among the list of Top 100 DJs in the world His debut full-length album Forever was released on 22 May 2015 by Def Jam Recordings.<br><br>Music career<br><br>Lindblad was born in Stockholm, and is of Swedish and Italian descent. He started playing piano at age 7, but became interested in EDM when he was 16. Alesso first gained recognition with the release of his Alesso EP in 2010. In early 2011, Sebastian Ingrosso of Swedish House Mafia contacted Alesso and asked if he wanted to work together. Ingrosso introduced him to DJing and helped him with the production of tracks. Since that time, Ingrosso has acted as a mentor for Alesso, who referred to the elder Swede as a 'big brother.' Despite having learned to DJ in 2011, Alesso made his debut on DJ Magazine's list of the top 100 DJs at number 70 in that same year.<br><br>One of the first songs Alesso produced with Sebastian Ingrosso was a 2011 track named 'Calling' that reached number 2 on the Beatport charts. The song would later be renamed 'Calling (Lose My Mind)' with an additional feature from Ryan Tedder. Alesso's 2011 remix of 'Pressure' by Nadia Ali premiered at the #1 spot on The Hype Machine and was one of the most played EDM songs of 2011. From that point, his popularity continued to rise. MTV named him one of the 'EDM Rookies to Watch in 2012', and he recorded a BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix in March 2012. He played for a crowd of 60,000 at Creamfields, and accompanied Madonna on her MDNA World Tour at select European shows. By the end of 2012, Alesso had released another original mix called 'Years' featuring Matthew Koma that performed well in the United Kingdom. He was also ranked 20th on the list of the top 100 DJs of 2012 by DJ Magazine.<br><br>By 2013, Alesso had played at music festivals like Coachella, Electric Daisy Carnival, Ultra Music Festival, and Tomorrowland. He released a remix of 'If I Lose Myself' by OneRepublic that was nominated for Grammy and garnered almost a million listens on SoundCloud in a relatively short time. In a collaboration with Calvin Harris and Hurts, Alesso released 'Under Control' which racked up 88 million views. In 2013, he also achieved his highest ranking on the list of the top 100 DJs at number 13. In July 2014, Alesso signed with Def Jam Recordings, becoming only the second EDM producer to sign with the label (after Afrojack). He also debuted a new track called 'Tear the Roof Up', which was named a 'Future Exclusive' by Zane Lowe. The music video for 'Tear The Roof Up' was released exclusively through SnapChat in September 2014. Alesso also embarked on his 'Heroes Tour', named after his single 'Heroes (We Could Be)' featuring Tove Lo. During the tour, Alesso teamed up with Chime for Change, a global charity that seeks to 'improve the lives of women around the world.' Alesso's involvement with the charity has raised over $50,000 as of October 2014. His debut studio album was originally set to be released in the first quarter of 2015, but was later released on May 22, 2015. It includes both 'Heroes (We Could Be)' and 'Tear the Roof Up'. The single for 'Heroes (We Could Be)' was officially released on December 15, 2014. His new single, titled 'Cool' and featuring Roy English, premiered on February 13, 2015, on BBC Radio 1. The track, which samples Kylie Minogue's 'Get Outta My Way', was officially released in Europe on February 16, 2015 and in North America on February 17, 2015.<br><br>On September 30, 2016, his new version of 'I Wanna Know' featuring Taiwanese singer Jolin Tsai was officially released.

On October 1, 2016, Alesso and Tsai performed the single 'I Wanna Know' and a remix version of Tsai's hit 'Play' together at the Storm Music Festival in Shanghai. On October 4, 2016, it was announced that Alesso would be releasing a new version of the song 'Years', collaborating with K-pop band Exo's member, Chen.
