<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
   Sixth album from Finnish goth rockers follows 2005's 'Dark Light'. Working once again with producer extraordinaire Tim Palmer (Robert Plant, The Mission, Ozzy Osbourne), they havepulled out all the stops to unleash what they have called their heaviest album yet, describing it as a cross between Metallica and My Bloody Valentine. Doom-influenced guitars roar while pin-up frontman Ville Valo delivers, in his dulcet croon, dark tales inspired by his battle with alcoholism. Includes the single 'The Kiss Of Dawn'.
