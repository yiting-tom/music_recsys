<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
   So finally one of the most anticipated debut albums this year, 'We Stitch These Wounds', has finally landed on the music waves, and I have to say it doesn't disappoint. With a fan fervor that matches the Bieber fever, the Black Veil Brides army can be satisfied with an actual full length CD that they can play over and over again. To the new people finding out about them, their image may be a bit polarizing and off putting. However, I think that the image adds to their overall draw. They want to create a complete band including the good music and a particular look. They have said that they can be whatever kind of band someone wants, and they fulfill that with this album. With some awesome guitars by Jake Pitts and Jinxx, and some great work by Ashley Purdy on bass, they bring in those people that love A7X, BFMV, Atreyu, etc. For anybody who loves good drummers, they will be amazed by Miss Sandra on the drums. Yes, they have a female drummer! She is truly a unique feature to this band. Now, to Mr. Andy Six, he definitely has a beautiful deep voice that is intriguing to listen to. There is intensity in his voice, but also a beautiful melody in songs like 'The Mortician's Daughter' and 'Carolyn'. His voice captures you in songs like 'Sweet Blasphemy', 'Beautiful Remains', and 'Heaven's Calling'. Now, in saying that, this album is definitely a first step for this band. It is a little all over the place, and the voice of this band is still being refined. I think with getting this first album under them, and touring around for a while, they will bust out another album that will truly blow all stereotypes away. There is true potential in this band, and 'We Stitch These Wounds' showcases that very well. For the fans that have followed them, enjoy having the full length album we have waited so long for. To the people who are unsure, listen to the album and block out the other thoughts you have. You will see potential for this young band! <br>
