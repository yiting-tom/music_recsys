I've done some bad things, but i like to have my fun, there's a thousand ways to heaven, a thousand ways to hell, but I do say the good lord helps those that help themselves, so help yourself<br><br>Moses was a great man, he parted the waters of the red sea, Down the road to Egypt, made sure the slaves were free.<br>Well, he could speak to god they say, yes indeed, but the sound of his voice would have made our poor ears bleed<br><br>Moses, he had an army, I tell ya, all his own, they stood in circles outside his very home and when the Pharohs got to killing they left old Moses alone, But the romans drove the nails through old Jesus' bones<br><br>Well, now I ain't no preacher man, No preacher man's son.  I've done some bad things, but i like to have my fun, why they got Jesus now, and not Moses, None can tell.  But they say the good lord helps those who help themselves, so help yourself now.<br><br>
