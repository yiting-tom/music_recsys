Nazel<br><br>[Intro]<br>Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings<br>But I'm only going to get this one chance<br>Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)<br>Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what<br>If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble – big trouble – and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances<br>You were just what the doctor ordered<br><br>[Hook 1]<br>I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God<br>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod<br>Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?<br>They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot<br><br>[Verse 1]<br>But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes<br>I got a laptop in my back pocket<br>My pen'll go off when I half-cock it<br>Got a fat knot from that rap profit<br>Made a living and a killing off it<br>Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office<br>With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack<br>I'm an MC still as honest<br>But as rude and as indecent as all hell<br>Syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)<br>This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip-hop<br>You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap<br>Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, backpack rap crap, yep, yep, yackity-yak<br>Now at the exact same time<br>I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that<br>I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table<br>Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half<br>Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact<br>How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack<br>Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxipad<br>It's actually disastrously bad for the wack<br>While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as<br><br>[Hook 2]<br>I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God<br>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod<br>Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?<br>Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard<br><br>[Verse 2]<br>Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got<br>Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance<br>Everybody loves to root for a nuisance<br>Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since<br>MC's get taken to school with this music<br>Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme<br>Now I lead a new school full of students<br>Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-<br>-W.A, Cube, Hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim<br>Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position<br>To meet Run DMC, induct them, into the motherfuckin' Rock n'<br>Roll Hall of Fame<br>Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames<br>Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame<br>On the wall of shame<br>You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames<br>Off a plank, and tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?<br>Little gay looking boy<br>So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy<br>You witnessing a massacre<br>Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy<br>Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy<br>You get a thumbs up, pat on the back<br>And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy<br>Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?<br>I get a 'hell yeah' from Dre looking boy<br>I'mma work for everything I have<br>Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy<br>Basically boy you're never gonna be capable<br>To keeping up with the same pace looking boy<br><br>[Hook 3]<br>I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God<br>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod<br>The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar<br>Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God<br>Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard<br><br>[Verse 3]<br>So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent<br>Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'<br>And I should not be woken<br>I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating<br>But I got your mom deep throating<br>I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle<br>I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil<br>It's me, my honesty's brutal<br>But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though<br>For good at least once in a while<br>So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle<br>Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times<br>But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned<br>Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime<br>I know there was a time where once I<br>Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind<br>So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine<br>Appeal with the skin color of mine<br>You get too big and here they come trying to censor you<br>Like that one line I said on 'I'm Back' from the Mathers LP1<br>Where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine<br>Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine<br>See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was<br>But I've morphed into an immortal coming through the portal<br>You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though<br>And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for<br>You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows<br>You're like normal, fuck being normal<br>And I just bought a new Raygun from the future<br>To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad<br>Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad<br>Singin' to a man while they played piano<br>Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel<br>So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day<br>''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''<br>Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)<br>Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human<br>What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman<br>Innovative and I'm made of rubber<br>So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you<br>I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating<br>How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating<br>Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting<br>For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating<br>Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated<br>I make elevating music, you make elevator music<br>Oh, he's too mainstream<br>Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it<br>It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it<br>With rock, shock rap with Doc<br>Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it<br>I don't know how to make songs like that<br>I don't know what words to use<br>Let me know when it occurs to you<br>While I'm ripping any one of these verses, that versus you<br>It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you<br>How many verses I gotta murder to prove<br>That if you're half as nice at songs, you can sacrifice virgins too (ughhh)<br>School flunkie, pill junky<br>But look at the accolades the skills brung me<br>Full of myself, but still hungry<br>I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to<br>And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues<br>But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you<br>I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat<br>Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky<br>But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling<br>Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me<br>They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate<br>But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have<br>Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation<br>And understand the discrimination<br>But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then<br>But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?<br>Don't mistake it for Satan<br>It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas<br>And take a vacation to trip abroad<br>And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard<br>Be a king? Think not - why be a king when you can be a God?<br><br>
