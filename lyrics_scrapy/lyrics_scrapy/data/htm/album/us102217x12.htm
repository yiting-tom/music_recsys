<br>
   Sheryl Crow's first Christmas album, Home for Christmas, is available in Hallmark Gold Crown® stores now. The CD features an original song Crow wrote called 'There Is a Star That Shines Tonight' as well as nine other tracks she personally chose to record. The CD is being sold exclusively through Hallmark Gold Crown stores through the end of December. The announcement was made by Jill Rosen, director of Hallmark licensing.<br><br>?Sheryl?s voice and talent are a perfect complement to the holiday season and we are very excited to have the privilege of working with such an accomplished musician for this debut holiday project,? said Rosen.<br><br>Crow recorded the tracks in Los Angles with long-time associate Bill Bottrell as producer (he produced her debut album Tuesday Night Music Club as well as her current hit album Detours). In true Sheryl-style, the holiday album features a mixture of rockin? traditional songs, funky soul, blues and even a little gospel. Along with Crow?s first original Christmas song, fans will also hear traditional tunes including ?Go Tell it on the Mountain,? ?Merry Christmas Baby,? ?All Through the Night? and others.<br><br>Crow describes the album as one that will offer up surprises and she adds, ?I think music generally is an incredible heart opener and the tradition of Christmas carols and hymns really taps into the spirit and the meaning of Christmas. When I recorded this album, I envisioned delivering the kind of music people could relate to during this season.?<br><br>The voice of hits like ?Soak Up the Sun,? ?All I Wanna Do,? ?If it Makes You Happy? and ?Every Day is a Winding Road,? Sheryl Crow entered the national stage in the early '90s and emerged as one of the most prolific and successful artists of that decade. In the midst of a national tour to support her most recent studio album, Detours, Crow has won over fans with her easy musical versatility and story-telling style. A nine-time Grammy winner, Crow has recorded six Platinum-selling studio albums since her 1993 debut, each having charted in the Top 10.<br><br>The recording of the Crow Christmas album reflects Hallmark?s ongoing commitment to partnering with world-renowned artists in the music industry. Hallmark Gold Crown is the only specialty retailer to have achieved Platinum and Gold certification for eight of its seasonal CDs, selling five million copies. George Strait?s 2006 Hallmark Christmas album achieved Platinum status one week after it was released and James Taylor?s Hallmark Christmas album achieved Platinum status after 31 days. In addition, Hallmark Christmas CDs by Michael McDonald (2005) and Barry Manilow (2007) were certified Gold. The album is priced at $7.95 with each purchase of three Hallmark cards. Consumers can visit Hallmark.com or call 1-800-HALLMARK to find a Hallmark Gold Crown store in their area. Hallmark CDs are sold exclusively by nearly 3,500 Hallmark Gold Crown<br><br> <br>
