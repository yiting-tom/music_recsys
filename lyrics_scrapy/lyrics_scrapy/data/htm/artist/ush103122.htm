<dd class="hb0">Rialto were a Britpop band of the late 1990s. They released their self-titled debut album in 1998, and Night on Earth in 2002. Their most famous singles were their debut, 'Monday Morning 5.19', and 'Untouchable', which charted higher at number 20 in the UK Singles Chart.<br><br>Band members<br><br>    Louis Eliot – lead vocalist, guitar, songwriter<br>    Jonny Bull – guitar, programming, backing vocals, producer<br>    Julian Taylor – bass, backing vocals and trumpet<br>    Pete Cuthbert – drums<br>    Toby Hounsham – keyboards (1997–2000)<br>    Anthony Christmas – drums (1997–2000)<br><br>Biography<br><br>Rialto grew from the remains of the band Kinky Machine, which featured singer Louis Eliot and guitarist Jonny Bull. Kinky Machine has released two albums, their self-titled debut in 1993 (Oxygen/MCA Records) and Bent in 1995.<br><br>In 1997 Bull and Elliot, along with the Julian Taylor, drummer Pete Cuthbert, and Toby Hounsham, rejoined and formed Rialto. Later that year they released their first singles, 'When We're Together' and 'Untouchable'. The latter was re-released in January 1998 and cracked the Top 20 in the UK chart. Despite the anticipated arrival of their self-titled debut album, East West Records dropped them. Instead China Records released the band's debut album on 13 July 1998. The six-track Girl On A Train EP followed two years later, receiving accolades from NME and Q magazines. By the time Rialto gathered to make a second album, Hounsham and Christmas had left the group leaving them as a four-piece. The band finally released their second (and final) album in March 2002; Night on Earth.<br>Post band activities<br><br>Following the band's split, Eliot released his solo debut, the Everybody Loves You When You're Dead EP in 2002, followed by his full-length debut Long Way Round (Iodine Records) in 2004.<br><br>Bull co-wrote the song 'Friday Night' with Lily Allen at his studio in southwest Portugal. The song ended up on her debut album Alright, Still. In 2011, he wrote and sang the song for the 'Ph. Diddy' video produced by Invitrogen to illustrate life in a biotechnology laboratory.</dd>
