Beck<br><br>[Hook：Jhene Aiko]<br>What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it<br>You've been caught up with them bitches<br>I don't get it, you're a star love<br>You shouldn't have to deal with that<br>I'll never make you feel like that<br><br>Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us<br>That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us<br>So what are you? what are you, what are you so afraid of?<br>Darling you, you give but you cannot take love<br><br>[Verse 1: Drake]<br>I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive<br>Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance<br>I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping<br>I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different<br>Started realizing a couple places I can take it<br>I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement<br>I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation<br>And influence a generation that's lacking in patience<br>I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience<br>Just me and my old man getting back to basics<br>We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted<br>When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing<br>Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas<br>We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us<br>We even talked about you and our couple of moments<br>He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups<br>You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone<br>Looking like you came from the 70's on your own<br>My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is<br>Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?<br>Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore<br>I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored<br>But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?<br>Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?<br><br>[Hook]<br>What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it<br>You've been caught up with them bitches<br>I don't get it, you're a star love<br>You shouldn't have to deal with that<br>I'll never make you feel like that<br><br>Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us<br>That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us<br>So what are you? what are you, what are you so afraid of?<br>Darling you, you give but you cannot take love<br><br>[Verse 2: Drake]<br>Thinkin' about Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures<br>Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage<br>When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit<br>A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it<br>Cause that night I played her three songs<br>Then we talked about something we disagreed on<br>Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz<br>Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off<br>Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria<br>Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria<br>Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music<br>When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it<br>The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street<br>I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me<br>Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?<br>Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't<br>Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz<br>Girl I thought we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision<br>Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions<br>When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven<br>It seems like you don't want this love anymore<br>I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore<br>But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?<br>Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?<br><br>[Hook]<br>What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it<br>You've been caught up with them bitches<br>I don't get it, you're a star love<br>You shouldn't have to deal with that<br>I'll never make you feel like that<br><br>Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us<br>That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us<br>So what are you? what are you, what are you so afraid of?<br>Darling you, you give but you cannot take love<br><br>
