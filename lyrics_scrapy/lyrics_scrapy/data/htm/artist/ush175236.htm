<dd class="hb0">Bleachers is an American indie pop act based in New York City. It is the official stage name of songwriter and record producer Jack Antonoff, who is also part of the bands Steel Train and Fun. Bleachers' pop music was heavily influenced by the late '80s, early '90s and the high school-based films of John Hughes while still using modern production techniques. Their first single, 'I Wanna Get Better', was released February 18, 2014.<br><br>Background<br><br>While on the road with his band, Fun, Antonoff began working on a new project during his time in different cities. For about a year he kept the project a secret until February 18, 2014 where the first single 'I Wanna Get Better' was released along with the launch of Bleachers' website, social media profiles, and a selection of tour dates. News of Bleachers was first publicly announced in a Facebook post by Brooklyn music studio Mission Sound in May 2013.<br><br>About making the album, Antonoff said, 'I spent the past year working on the music but not talking about it, and eventually it became this psychotic alter-ego situation, where it was second nature to have this part of me that no one knew about. Except for a small group of people, most of which happened to be members of my immediate family, no one was aware that this music, or this album even existed ... even though it existed so deeply to me.' Antonoff also stated that Bleachers was never meant to be a departure from his position in Fun., and that he will remain in the band.<br><br>Bleachers' debut album Strange Desire was released July 15, 2014, from RCA Records. Variance Magazine called the single 'Rollercoaster' a 'brilliant summer anthem.' Since March 2015,[timeframe?] Bleachers has been on its debut Come Alive! tour, which features Night Terrors of 1927 and Joywave as opening acts. On September 25, 2015, Bleachers released Terrible Thrills, Vol. 2, a sequel to Strange Desire with songs from Strange Desire being covered by numerous artists with modified tunes. The band appeared as the fictional band Baby Goya and The Nuclear Winters in the 2015 film Hello, My Name Is Doris.<br><br>Bleachers' second album Gone Now was released June 2, 2017. Its lead single 'Don't Take the Money' has been described by Atwood Magazine as 'an epic uplifting pop-rock anthem ultimately about how when love is real, its worth everything that comes along with it'. The band is currently on its Gone Now Era: Part 1 tour which features Bishop Briggs and Tangerine as openers.</dd>
