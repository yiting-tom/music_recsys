Wrong ho!'<br><br>[DMX]<br>Uhh, yo yo<br>Yo, not this shit again<br>Dog gon' be a dog, y'knahmean? Motherfuckin dog!<br>Don't GET a dog, you can't take care of a dog<br>Gotta take care of the dog, y'know? Y'know?<br>Take it easy lady, y'know? Uh-huh<br>Give me a motherfuckin break - will ya?<br><br>Shorty was the bomb, brownskin honey with a little dough<br>Come to find out she was a little ho, but still yo<br>I pushed up, shorty had that ass like BLA-DOW<br>Had me schemin on how, I could get that now<br>Was like GIRLFRIEND (what?!) let me drop a bug in yo' ear<br>She was mine cause I told her what she wanted to hear<br>Was like yeah, she knew how it was goin down<br>She said page me, code zero, cause I know you get around<br>Didn't have a man but even if she did DEAD<br>Cause my game is tight like a stocking cap on a nigga's head<br>I said - we'll get up like nine or somethin<br>Don't act like, when I say that ass is mine I'm frontin<br>That night was right, she let me get that, hit that<br>Rip that, bounce it off the walls, flip that<br>But only, one thing went wrong, the rubber bust<br>But I didn't fuss cause dog, shorty was the bomb!<br><br>[Chorus: DMX *singing*]<br>Shortyyyy, UH!<br>We only did it for that niiiight<br>But maaan the pussy was good (uh-huh)<br>But shorty's fuckin up my liiife, fuckin up my life<br>Shortyyyy, UH!<br>We only did it for that niiiight (just one motherfuckin night man!)<br>But maaan the pussy was good<br>(was gooder than a motherfucker, I ain't gon' front)<br>But shorty's fuckin up my liiife (uh-huh)<br>C'mon ma, give me a break<br><br>[DMX]<br>A few days later, I hit her up, just to keep it real (aight)<br>Was like - whassup Boo, how you been, how you feel? (aight)<br>She said - aight, but my friend's kinda late<br>Today's the 13th, and it shoulda been here on the 8th<br>I'm like - f'real?! Don't stress it, it'll come<br>It better, cause I can't afford another, little one<br>She said - neither can I, I said - cool<br>cause I got mad shit to do and you still goin to school<br>So at least we had the same thing in mind (uh-huh)<br>Not to have this kid and, everything would be fine, BUT, I was blind<br>to the fact that she was settin me up, for the kill (c'mon)<br><br>Damn, why wasn't she, on the pill?<br>And I still, would check on her like, once a week<br>Sometimes I hit it, sometimes I didn't, but shorty was a freak<br>And whenever I would speak on the baby<br>Shorty would be like - I ain't havin this kid, is you crazy?<br><br>[Chorus: DMX *singing*]<br>But shortyyyy, UH!<br>We only did it for that niiiight<br>(man listen man, one motherfuckin night)<br>But maaan the pussy was good<br>(I ain't gon' front, pussy was good as a motherfucker)<br>But shorty's fuckin up my liiife<br>(Oh MAN this bitch is a fuckin HEADACHE!) fuckin up my life<br>Shortyyyy, UH! (Shorty was definitely a bomb dog)<br>We only did it for that niiiight<br>(One motherfuckin night, AND I was drunk)<br>But maaan the pussy was good<br>(The pussy, MAN! Let me tell you)<br>But shorty's fuckin up my liiife (Dog, this bitch is a problem)<br>C'mon ma, give me a break<br><br>[DMX]<br>By now, wasn't lookin too good<br>Cause she wasn't doin things that she told me she would<br>Like gettin the price checked out for what we had to do<br>And it goes up another yard for every month after two<br>and a half I had to laugh out of frustration (WHAT?!)<br>Now she's fo' months, I'm ready to hit the bus station (man)<br>If I was, still on that shit it woulda made me rob her<br>Told her friends - DMX? Yeah that's my baby's father (uh-oh)<br>Her lil' stomach is shown (uh-huh) so now the heat is on<br>Maybe she'll see the light, if I start to treat her wrong<br>Like if she thought that if she kept the baby she would keep me (what?)<br>So I played the game on her level, got sneaky (aight?!)<br>Let her have the kid, she said it was premature (uh-huh)<br>Found out, she was six months, when she said she was four (uh-huh)<br>So I left her with the pressure on the next man's arm<br>But she'll be aight, cause shorty was the bomb (f'real)<br><br>[Chorus: DMX *singing*]<br>But shortyyyy, UH! (was the bomb)<br>We only did it for that niiiight<br>(I mean what, one fuckin night? C'mon ma)<br>But maaan the pussy was good (man she sucked a mean dick)<br>But shorty's fuckin up my liiife<br>(Now this bitch won't stop callin, what the fuck man?)<br>Fuckin up my life<br>Shortyyyy, UH! (She was kinda cute though)<br>We only did it for that niiiight (All it takes is one night man, haha)<br>But maaan the pussy was good (mmm-mm-mmm!)<br>But shorty's fuckin up my liiife (This bitch, has got to go)<br>C'mon ma, give me a break<br><br>
