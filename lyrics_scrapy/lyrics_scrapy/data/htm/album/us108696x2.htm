<br>
<br>
   8 years, 12 band members, 2 albums, 12 countries, and almost 500 shows later, Much The Same had a good run, but that time has now passed. Thanks so much to everyone that every supported our band and enjoyed our music; it fills us with pride and joy even now when we hear of a new fan or that our songs have somehow affected someone's life in even the smallest way. I hope that even though the four of us will no longer be making music together, that the music you have now will continue to inspire you for years to come. <br><br>For anyone who missed it, Dan and I separately decided that this band (and probably music altogether) was no longer something we wanted to pursue as a career, and unfortunately continuing it as a hobby was not an option for everyone involved. This decision had nothing to do with our fans, who we greatly appreciate, or our music, which means a lot to us, but simply the direction we felt our lives needed to go in the future. <br><br>Frank is currently looking to join a new band, and Jevin is going to be touring with Blacktop Mourning this summer. We will still include news here and on our myspace page whenever one of us has something new happening. <br><br>Thanks again to every one of you, especially those who came to shows, bought our album (or even copied it), gave us a place to crash on the road, and especially donated money when we were in desperate need. Hope to see you all again someday! <br><br>Gunner &amp; Much The Same
