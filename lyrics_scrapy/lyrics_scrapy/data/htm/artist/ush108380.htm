<dd class="hb0">Miriam Webster is an Australian Pentecostal worship leader and contemporary singer/songwriter. She is most well known for her classical worship songs with Hillsong Music Australia. Miriam won A.C.E State Student music award as a teenager for singing at the convention in Queensland, Australia. While staying in Sydney in 1996 she joined her friend who attended Hills Christian Life Centre which is known today as Hillsong Church to go to a Friday night youth service. Miriam was asked to sing this night as they were looking for an item so she sang a song she had penned years before called 'Fall upon your knees'. She joined the worship team months later and from there she has led worship in services, rallies, connect groups and conferences. She has toured Australia, New Zealand, Asia and the United States, and recently released her solo album Made Me Glad.<br><br>She served with the Hillsong Church in Sydney from 1996 to 2007 and was featured on numerous Hillsong Music praise-and-worship albums since 1997.
