<br>
<br>
Known for its tireless touring and pronounced affection for the Gin Blossoms, Smalltown Poets has produced pop that's more potent than many of its Christian peers. Still, a few observers (including this critic) have wondered whether the group has yet to tap its artistic potential. On Third Verse lead vocalist Michael Johnston and company take a commendable step towards toughening and sharpening their sound, drawing on a range of rockin' influences from David Garza to Collective Soul. Judging by a nine-song pre-release (all that was available at press time), Smalltown has embraced more angular textures without losing its knack for crisp melodies. Perhaps the peak moment is the cover of The 77s' tune 'The Lust, the Flesh, the Eyes and the Pride of Life.' Despite its tongue-twisting title, this number could easily pass for a classic Byrds tune with its 12-string electric guitar and yearning chorus harmonies. Like a man with his back to the wall, Johnston delivers his vocal pinned against a pulsating down-tuned bass. It's a beautiful, sad song that chronicles the dark side of human nature with stark emotional honesty.<br><br>Elsewhere, 'Clean' unfolds from a stripped drum loop into an engaging volley of guitar lines and feedback, propelled by a sweetly soaring chorus. And for fans of the vintage Smalltown sound, 'Every Reason' boasts a ready-for-radio chorus (and owes more than a passing nod to the Blossoms). Still, there's room to mature; lyrically, Smalltown is solid but often formulaic. But alas, growth often comes one album at a time. Third Verse raises the musical bar a notch. Now, if the band can live up to its moniker and take chances with its wordsmithing, greatness awaits. -- Lou Carlozo (c) 2000 CCM Communications, Inc. -- From CCM Magazine -- Subscribe Now! <br><br>1.
