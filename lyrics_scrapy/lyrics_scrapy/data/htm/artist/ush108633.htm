<dd class="hb0">DecembeRadio was an American Christian rock band formed in 2003 and composed of bassist and lead vocalist Josh Reedy, lead guitarist Brian Bunn, rhythm guitarist Eric Miker and drummer Boone Daughdrill.<br><br>Reedy, Bunn and Miker first ventured out on their own as DecembeRadio after a stint as touring band for evangelist Billy Wayne Arrington. After a year of gigging, DecembeRadio released two independent albums in early 2005. Following their signing with Slanted Records and the addition of Daughdrill on drums, the band released DecembeRadio in June 2006. The album was nominated for 'Best Rock Or Rap Gospel Album' at the 49th Grammy Awards, and won the 2007 Dove Award for 'Rock Album of the Year'. A follow-up, Satisfied, was released in August 2008. DecembeRadio dissolved in 2012, and the members moved on to other musical projects.<br><br>Musically, DecembeRadio is heavily influenced by hard rock and blues-rock from the 1970s, owing to early exposure to family members' record collections. Their sound has been compared to that of Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, The Black Crowes and Lenny Kravitz, among others.<br><br>Members<br><br>    Brian Bunn – lead guitar, vocals (2003–12)<br>    Eric Miker – rhythm guitar, vocals (2003–12)<br>    Josh Reedy – lead vocals, bass guitar (2003–12)<br>    Boone Daughdrill – drums, percussion (2005–10)<br><br>Discography<br><br>    Dangerous (January 2005, independent)<br>    Noise (January 2005, independent)<br>    DecembeRadio (June 2006, Slanted)<br>    Satisfied (August 2008, Slanted)<br>    Live (March 2010, Slanted)<br>    Southern Attic Sessions (EP) (August 2011, Slanted)</dd>
