<br>
I-pod headphone listening experience Part 2: I hopped on my bicycle and took a journey through the back lakes and quarry of my hometown. The sun was shining bright, and nature was at its finest. All the while, my soundtrack was the new album by Masterchief Mike Patton (Faith No more, Mr. Bungle, Fantomas, Peeping Tom) and his tribe known as Tomahawk, also comprised of little Indians Duane Denison, (U.S.S.A, ex-Jesus Lizard) and John Stanier (Battles, ex-Helmet). The theme this time around is reinterpretations of Native American tunes. The original composers we do not know, and thus the album is appropriately titled Anonymous. Duane Denison was curious to find Native American tunes that were more Spooky, aggressive, and kinetic.<br><br>He came across books written in the time of President Teddy Roosevelt. With these findings of Native American music transcriptions, Tomahawk set out on their mission to shed light on these wonderful and powerful indigenous music.Denison and Stanier recorded their parts in Nashville while Patton added vocals and samples at Vulcan Studios in San Francisco. Patton's style is evident from the first measure in. As I continued my ride, I became one with Mother Nature; I felt an incredible spirit flow all around.<br><br>- Andy Smyth -- Zeromag, June 2007<br><br>When ex-Jesus Lizard guitarist Duane Denison, ex-Faith No More singer Mike Patton and ex-Helmet drummer John Stanier formed Tomahawk and put out their self-titled album in 2001, their name had nothing to do with their style of progressive avant-metal. But with their third disc, Anonymous (out June 19), the band has delved into the tribal sounds of Native American music and created Tomahawk's most evocative and cinematic work yet. 'It was not our idea to do an album like this when we started the band, ' Denison tells Headbangers Blog, but now that we've done it, it seems like it was destined to happen. ' Denison, who arranged most of the album, became interested in Native American music and culture several years ago after touring Indian Reservations with Hank Williams III. He soon discovered a variety of contemporary Native American blues and new age musicians, but nothing truly heavy. 'I was somewhat disappointed by the Native bands,' Denison says. 'I figured there must be native music somewhere that was more aggressive, spookier and more kinetic.' Denison's research led him to books of transcribed Indian songs from the early 1900s, around the time of Teddy Roosevelt's presidency, when the public had particular interest in Indian culture and artifacts. Tomahawk's Anonymous is composed of reworked versions of these songs, combining the atmosphere of the originals with a heavy, modern approach. Denison and Stanier recorded guitars and drums for the album in Nashville and Patton later recorded vocals and samples in San Francisco. 'The arranging and recording of these tunes began about a year ago,' Denison says. 'And we had to work in sections, like a movie. But the album came together quite easily once we got started and had all listened to the rough demos. I think Tomahawk fans are a fairly adventurous bunch and will enjoy this departure.' While the music on Tomahawk is serious and ominous, Denison hasn't lost his sense of humor. When Headbangers Blog asks him if he had any revelatory encounters with medicine men during his tour of the reservations, he replies. 'I never met any medicine men, but I did meet a medicine woman named Doctor Quinn... Sorry.' That's alright, Duene. Just keep your day job. -- Headbanger's Blog, April 19,2007
