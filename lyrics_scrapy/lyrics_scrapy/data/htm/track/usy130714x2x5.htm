NawhatImsayin'? That's my shorty right there. Know that<br><br>[Chorus (2x)：]<br>She was ill<br>With looks that fit the bill<br>Lips like Mary J, eyes like Lauren Hill<br>Body like Big Lez<br>Backyard and thick legs<br>But the only time we got along was in the bed<br><br>[Verse 1:]<br>Yo, she had an attitude<br>Of monumental magnitude<br>Couldn't take her anywhere without the broad actin' rude<br>Even with your family she had no gratitude<br>I took her to my mom's crib she started snappin' on the food!<br>Goes without sayin' that my moms wasn't feelin' it<br>Wild out, tried to hit shorty with a skillet<br>I held moms back, told ole girl to leave<br>But moms already had a hand full of weave<br>Shorty crouched down so she could bob and weave<br>Moms dropped the skillet and rolled up her sleeves<br>Cornered off the kitchen with grace and ease<br>Hit her with a three piece and brought her to her knees<br>There wasn't too much that I could say<br>Cause I already told shorty, 'Moms don't play'<br>I know it's kinda hard to believe<br>But the worst part is that this popped off on Christmas Eve<br>And after all the drama me and shorty been through<br>I can't front yo<br>She's still my boo<br>After all the drama me and shorty been through<br>I can't front yo<br>She's still my boo<br><br>[Chorus]<br><br>[Verse Two]<br>Yo, she had an attitude<br>That made it hard to deal with<br>One night we was at the club on some chill shit<br>I had a Long Island get it nice and drink it<br>I spotted the next man across the bar peepin'<br>Thinkin', I don't mind if he scopes out my honey<br>Cause she wants me to buy her drinks but I'm out of money<br>On the reals<br>Seein' dude kinda made me happy<br>So I decided to slide and let him play the sugar daddy<br>'Hey boo, I'm about to slide to the bathroom<br>Get some more loot for you, but I'll be back soon<br>And I better not catch you creepin' on me neither<br>Or somebody might be gettin' slapped with this empty Zima'<br>I was perpin'<br>Just to see how she would act<br>But I'll be damned if dude wasn't in my seat when I came back<br>I walked up<br>So only she could see me<br>With a bottle in my hand like I was about to sneak him<br>Face ice grillin' and she went for the baby<br>Because before I could say a word she slapped him in the face<br>Talkin' bout, 'I said I have a man. Get out of here.<br>I can't believe you would try to steal my man's chair.'<br>Dude turned around like, 'You're her man?!'<br>I'm like, 'Hell no!'<br>So he socked her in the jaw!<br>Took off his jacket like he was about to house her<br>But before they could square off here comes the bouncers<br>Ten deep<br>Tryin' to squash the action<br>Meanwhile I'm in the front row steady laughin'<br>I ain't never seen bouncers that raw<br>They kicked shorties ass from the bar to the door<br>By the time they finally tossed her ass outside<br>I had already pulled round and was waitin' in the ride<br>She was like, 'I thought you was my man, what happened to you!'<br>I'm like 'Awe girl, I was tryin' to help but they was holdin' me back boo!'<br>She was like, 'But how you just gonna say you ain't my man?'<br>'I was tryin' to confuse him but you ruined my plan.'<br>And after the drama me and my shorty been through<br>I can't front yo<br>She's still my boo<br>And after the drama me and my shorty been through<br>I can't front yo<br>She's still my boo<br><br>[Chorus]<br><br>[Verse Three]<br>Yo, she had an attitude<br>Too stuck up to eat fast food<br>I wanted Taco Bell<br>She's like 'You cheap as hell.'<br>See I wanted a chalupa but I knew she'd be frontin'<br>So I told her it was either Taco Bell, or nothin'<br>I had the upper hand cause she hadn't ate in hours<br>But she snatched my twenty dollars and ran up to the counter<br>And by the time I got inside she'd already ordered<br>So I played the background like I didn't even know her<br>Next thing I know she started yellin' bout her order<br>Talkin' to the girl behind the counter, screamin' on her<br>And when she walked around the corner to get a drink<br>The cashier looked at the cook and gave a wink<br>Awe, I knew right then and there she was about to take a loss<br>Cause the cook cleared his throat and gave her taco special sauce<br>I took her to the side and tried to tell her she got played<br>Then I realized, she didn't give me my change!<br>Hmmmm<br>So I decided to be quiet<br>Sat back and laughed as I watched the broad bite it<br><br>[Scratching]<br>'Bite it'<br><br>[Blueprint speaking]<br>Yeah, how's that taste? It's good? Okay cool<br>Yeah, Glad you like it. Take that down. Glad you like it boo<br><br>[Chorus]<br><br>
