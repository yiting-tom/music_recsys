I did!<br>Though I don't attach much importance to that now, or then<br>Then riding the old Garfield El downtown<br>And on up to State Street<br>And back to guns under the counter<br>Guns under the counter every time<br>Guns under the counter<br>And bowling on the second floor<br><br>I never liked Douglas park<br>And no one likes it now<br>But that's neither here nor there<br>There, or here<br>West of Crawford, where it is I stayed<br>Chicago straights alliterates<br>North, and south<br>I lived in the Ms<br>But it was down on the south side<br>Dr. Peter Pane and his brother had their doughnut factory<br>And I mention it now because<br><br>That one day<br>Now I wasn't there, we were in Davenport at that time<br>Some north side Irish bullets came zipping through that window<br>In Cicero<br>Never stand at a window<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>And past the counter<br>Looking for those men<br>Who had their guns behind the counter<br>And you could smell the boiled cabbage on those bullets<br>One of them managed to hit a young pinsetter in the leg<br>Wouldn't you know it<br>But luckily Panagoulis<br>Dr. Peter Pane<br>Was there to see to it<br>He took some special blackberry filling right out of his lunch bag<br>And applied it to the young man's wound<br>You see, Dr. Peter Pane was an interesting man<br>And an even more interesting doctor<br>As he would use no material or remedy that wasn't used in the manufacture<br>Of his doughnuts down on 82nd and Kedzie with his brother.<br>But he tempered this by the fact that he would rarely use ingredients<br>That didn't have some medicinal purpose<br>Or so he thought<br><br>Here in the doughnut factory<br>They have confectioner's sugar<br>So sweet it was caustic<br>And chocolate so bitter that it could kill typhus<br>Glazing so shiny<br>It could set back glaucoma<br>And filling so filling,<br>You didn't need stitches<br>The same special blackberry filling that was applied to the young man's wound<br>Blackberry filling that came straight from Dr. Peter Pane's lunch bag<br><br>We were in Davenport<br>With a big restaurant downtown<br>And I once kept a jackrabbit in the back yard<br>And I'd walk across the river to Rock Island to Greek school<br>On a fine fall day<br>And I'd look up at the sky<br>And down at the river<br>But Davenport changed its name to Hooverville<br>So to speak, and we had to go to Chicago to move in with my aunt<br><br>
