<br>
<br>
When their previous band This Solemn Vow fell apart during the summer of 2006, Camden Cruz and Bryan Edwards decided to continue playing and recording new music just for fun. Their first song, 'Shadow And Flame,' helped earn Camden an endorsement with Bernie Rico Jr. Guitars. Camden was a central part of the opening ceremonies of the Daytona Supercross Championship in March 2007, playing in front of a crowd of over 50,000 people. This would go on to earn him an endorsement with Krank Amplification, and set Camden and Bryan's sights on higher goals. Continuing where they left off, Camden and Bryan re-recorded 'Shadow And Flame' with new lyrics and arrangement under the title 'Dragonflight.' This would be the first of many songs to come (eventually culminating into a full album of material). Knowing that solid recordings alone would not make them a true band, Camden and Bryan sought out other musicians who could compliment their style. Kevin Byrd joined soon afterward on rhythm guitars, as well as his brother Keith on drums. John Zambrotto and Cory Stene found their way into the band later on keyboards and bass, respectively. Under the name of Seven Kingdoms, they entered the legendary Morrisound Recording Studios in August 2007 and finished production on their debut album, 'Brothers of the Night'. They have also shared the stage with well known metal bands such as Sonata Arctica, The Agonist and The Absence. This is music of, by and for the metal community. We do not sacrifice musicianship for mediocrity. With inspiration gathered largely from the literary works of George R. R. Martin, and influences spanning the vastness of metal's subgenres, Seven Kingdoms seeks to carve its own niche in metal history and create something genuinely unique... yet undeniably METAL.
