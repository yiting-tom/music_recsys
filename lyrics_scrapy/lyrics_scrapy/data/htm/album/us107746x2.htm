<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
   White Lies', the new album by LoveHateHero, is not only a departure point for this young band, but in time, might well prove to be a departure point for the entire post-hardcore music scene. Over twelve songs, the band delivers what can only be described as the most hook laden post-hardcore tunes you have ever heard. This album will mark LoveHateHero's territory in the young new scene that is bubbling up in the wake of bands like Taking Back Sunday and Thursday. Their combination of pop-sensibility and stylistic toughness is unprecedented, resulting in an entirely memorable album, with songs you will find in your head for days and nights to come. This is not an exercise in deconstruction of song structure, or a spastic reinterpretation of the styles and phrasing that has come before them. Rather, the band focuses on delivering real `songs' in their own style - artfully arranged post-hardcore parts and metal-laced riffs, with melodies and choruses that are downright anthemic. Some of the elements will ring familiar - an early-Thrice sounding riff, Underoath inspired breakdowns, maybe a little My Chem dramatic sway in the chorus. But with this band, there is no sacrificing the payoff that's hardwired into each one their songs. Every tune hits the point where Pierrick Berube's voice launches the listener into that special place - of satisfaction, understanding, emotional lift. LoveHateHero will not abandon their listeners to dig for meaning or coherence out in their songs, they deliver it right to them. <br><br>Like with every growing young band between albums, there are palpable changes. The addition of young guns Myke Russell and Kevin Gruft on guitar, add not only a level of competence and metal-style execution, but Kevin's leads take the band to a new technical level that's both exciting and inspiring. Drummer Scot Gee brings the heat on the drums, taking cues from favorites DC of Tool and JT of the Mars Volta, he embellishes the songs with jazz inspired time signatures and a broad range of styles - from disco hi-hats in verses to galloping double-bass. Paris Bosserman returns on the bass, holding down the foundation, beating and sliding through the songs, and adding something new with his voice on this album, complimenting the lead vocals with some surprising high parts. <br><br>This record, we hear more revealing tales of personal life, love and lost cause, but Pierrick's lyrics also take the listener inside the van. We get to experience, in his first hand accounts, the highs and lows of living in a band - the resulting overexposure of ones self, the departure of former friends and band members, the snap judgment of others, the hopeless situations and glorious highs, all there for the listener to take in. These are the words of young men grown through two years on the road, times of trial and judgment, and revelation. A little older and wiser, now able to see through the 'White Lies' of naÃ¯ve promise and automatic fulfillment, the band has composed a dramatic and exciting record of their own life and times for the listener to join in on and enjoy the bumpy, but thrilling, ride.
