<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> Crazy Rap</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>(Wait a minute, man. Hey, check this out, tell it. It was this blind man, right?<br>Man, check this out- it was this blind man, right?<br>He was feelin' his way down the street with this stick, right?<br>Hey. He walked past this fish market, you know what I'm sayin'?<br>He stopped, he took a deep breath, he said,<br>Woooooo, good morning, ladies.<br>You like that shit, man? Hey, man, I got a gang of that shit, man.<br>I tell you what- my man on the guitar, fool on the drums,<br>everybody just crowd around the mic, I'll tell you all these mutha-fuckin' jokes.<br>But first, I'ma start it off like this. Hey, help me sing it, homeboy.)<br>Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need.<br>We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed.<br>And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns, singing them dirty rap songs<br>Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong, sell tapes from here to Hong Kong.<br>So roll, roll, roll my joint. Pick out the seeds and stems.<br>Feelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale, skatin' on Dayton rims.<br>So roll, roll the '83 Cadillac Coup de Ville.<br>If my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet my caddy will.<br><br>Well it was just sundown in a small white town. They call it Eastside Palmdale.<br>When the Afroman walked through the white land, houses went up for sale.<br>Well, I was standin' on the corner sellin' rap cds when I met a little girl named Jan.<br>I let her ride in my Caddy cause I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Klu Klux Klan.<br>We fucked on the bed, fucked on the flo', fucked so long, I grew a fuckin' afro.<br>Then I fucked to the left, fucked to the right. She sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white.<br>I thought to myself, Sheba, Sheba! Got my ass lookin' like a ZEBRA!<br>I pulled on my clothes and I was on my way, until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet.<br>I ran. I jumped out the back window, but her daddy, he was waitin' with a 2 x 4.<br>Oh, he beat me to the left, he beat me to the right. The mutha-fucker whooped my ass all night.<br>But I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad, that's the best damn pussy I ever had.<br>I got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine. I'm a fuck that bitch just one more time.<br><br>Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need.<br>We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed.<br>And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns, singing them dirty rap songs<br>Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong, sell tapes from here to Hong Kong.<br>So roll, roll, roll my joint. Pick out the seeds and stems.<br>Feelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale, skatin' on Dayton rims.<br>So roll, roll the '83 Cadillac Coup de Ville.<br>If my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet my caddy will.<br><br>I met this lady in Hollywood. She had green hair, but damn she looked good.<br>I took her to my house, cause she was fine, but she whipped out a dick that was bigger than mine.<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>I met this lady from Japan, never made love with an African.<br>I fucked her once, I fucked her twice. I ate that pussy like shrimp fried rice.<br>Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya. I met a woman in the heart of Australia.<br>Had a big butt and big titties, too, so I hopped in her ass like a kangaroo.<br>See, I met this lady from Hawaii. Stuck it in her ass, and she said, Aiiiiieeee!<br>Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch, then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch.<br>Met Colonel Sander's wife in the state of Kentucky. She said, I'll fry some chicken if you just fuck me.<br>I came in her mouth. It was a crisis. I gave her my secret blend of herbs and spices.<br><br>Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need.<br>We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed.<br>And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns, singing them dirty rap songs<br>Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong, sell tapes from here to Hong Kong.<br>Hey, wait a minute man, check this out.<br><br>I met Dolly Parton in Tennessee. Her titties were filled with Hennesy.<br>That country music nearly drove me crazy, but I rode that ass and said, Yes, Miss Daisy!<br>Met this lady in Oklahoma; put that pussy in a coma.<br>Met this lady in Michigan; I can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again.<br>Met a real black girl in South Carolina; fucked her 'til she turned into a white albino.<br>Fucked this hooker in Iowa. I fucked her on credit, so I owe her.<br>Fucked this girl, down in Georgia; came in her mouth. Man, I thought I told ya.<br>Met this beautiful sexy ho; she just ran cross the border of Mexico.<br>Fine young thing, said her name's Maria. I wrapped her up just like a Hot Tortilla.<br>I wanna get married, but I can't afford it. I know I'ma cry when she gets deported.<br><br>Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need.<br>We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed.<br>And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns, singing them dirty rap songs<br>Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong, sell tapes from here to Hong Kong.<br><br>Have you ever went over to a girl's house to fuck, but the pussy just ain't no good? (SAY WHAT?)<br>And then you're getting' upset cause you can't get her wet, plus you in the wrong neighborhood?<br>So you try to play it off and eat the pussy, but it takes her so long to come (SAY WHAT?)<br>Then a dude walks in. That's her big boyfriend, and he asks you where you from? (Where you from, man?)<br>So you wipe your mouth, and you try to explain (I don't bang.), you start talkin' real fast.<br>But he's already mad, cause you fuckin' his wife, so he starts beatin' on your ass.<br>Now your clothes all muddy, your nose all bloody, your dick was hard but now it's soft. (WHUT?)<br>You thought you had a girl to rock your world, now you still gotta go jack off.<br><br>Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need.<br>We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed.<br>[fade out]<br><br>
