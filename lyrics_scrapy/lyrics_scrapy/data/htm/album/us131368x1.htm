<br>
<br>
Metroid Metal s alter-ego is Stemage. And Stemage likes to rock out with crossover metal-pop that is part Incubus and part progressive catchy pop. Enigmatic and invigoratingly divergent styles collide here. It really reminds me of late 90 s crossover, before it was taken over by the nu-metal wannabes. The album is surprisingly dense and clear considering it was recorded by a single Shure SM57 microphone. --Smother Magazine<br><br>Coming from a guy that created an entire project devoted to turning classic Nintendo themes into metal songs, one might not expect the utmost seriousness from his projects. The man in question is Grant Henry, a one-man musical machine now representing himself under the name STEMAGE, a surprisingly serious musical project that pulls as equally from modern rock radio as it does metal. Henry plays all the instruments himself on STEMAGE's latest record, Strati (meaning 'layered') and is sure to point out that every instrument was recorded through one microphone and then layered appropriately. The first few tracks to Strati are all mid-tempo, guitar-driven affairs with Henry awkwardly coming into his own as a vocalist. The shocker as the songs continue comes when the sixth tune, 'Fabulous Fabulist,' starts off with growled vocals and a metal-tinged approach. It's the only track of its kind on Strati and seems to act more as a sarcastic tune, lyrically, than it does a serious track. While most of Henry's music could be considered serious, his lyrics are anything but. In the aforementioned song he seems to make fun of the music he is playing: 'that one song says it all/ you know the one with the breakdown in it/ .../ if I hear one more song about Armageddon, I'll start one myself.' In addition to this, Henry's got a song about illegal music downloading ('I've worked my whole life building my library/ whatever you do man, don't wipe my library) and a ballad about ballads ('ballads are fun, ballads are cool/ .../ there's nothing wrong with nothing out of the ordinary/ insert trendy distorted quote here/ OK, now we're ready'). By the time that ballad ('In Dependence') starts, Henry finally seems to hit his vocal stride as the concluding tunes are all quite better than the beginning ones. While the metal song on Strati is quite an odd addition considering what the rest of the album consists of, it represents a great turning point. Following that song, Strati plays out with a --Paste Punk <br><br>1. Star Ninety-Six<br>2. Calling The Kettle<br>3. Library<br>4. Luna<br>5. Strati Part 1<br>6. Fabulous Fabulist<br>7.
