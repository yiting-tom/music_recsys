<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> The Gift</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit. It was now Mid-August which meant he had<br>been separated from Marsha for more than two months. Two months, and all he had<br>to show was three dog-eared letters and two very expensive long-distance phone<br>calls. True, when school had ended and she'd returned to Wisconsin, and he to<br>Locust, Pennsylvania, she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity. She would<br>date occasionally, but merely as amusement. She would remain faithful.<br><br>But lately Waldo had begun to worry. He had trouble sleeping at night and when<br>he did, he had horrible dreams. He lay awake at night, tossing and turning<br>underneath his pleated quilt protector, tears welling in his eyes as he<br>pictured Marsha, her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothing of<br>some neanderthal, finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion.<br>It was more than the human mind could bear.<br><br>Visions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him. Daytime fantasies of sexual<br>abandon permeated his thoughts. And the thing was, they wouldn't understand how<br>she really was. He, Waldo, alone understood this. He had intuitively grasped<br>every nook and cranny of her psyche. He had made her smile. She needed him, and<br>he wasn't there (Awww...).<br><br>The idea came to him on the Thursday before the Mummers' Parade was scheduled<br>to appear. He'd just finished mowing and edging the Edelsons lawn for a dollar<br>fifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from<br>Marsha. There was nothing but a circular from the Amalgamated Aluminum Company<br>of America inquiring into his awing needs. At least they cared enough to write.<br><br>It was a New York company. You could go anywhere in the mails. Then it struck<br>him. He didn't have enough money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion,<br>true, but why not mail himself? It was absurdly simple. He would ship himself<br>parcel post, special delivery. The next day Waldo went to the supermarket to<br>purchase the necessary equipment. He bought masking tape, a staple gun and a<br>medium sized cardboard box just right for a person of his build. He judged that<br>with a minimum of jostling he could ride quite comfortably. A few airholes,<br>some water, perhaps some midnight snacks, and it would probably be as good as<br>going tourist.<br><br>By Friday afternoon, Waldo was set. He was thoroughly packed and the post<br>office had agreed to pick him up at three o'clock. He'd marked the package<br>'Fragile', and as he sat curled up inside, resting on the foam rubber<br>cushioning he'd thoughtfully included, he tried to picture the look of awe and<br>happiness on Marshas face as she opened her door, saw the package, tipped the<br>deliverer, and then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person. She<br>would kiss him, and then maybe they could see a movie. If he'd only thought of<br>this before. Suddenly rough hands gripped his package and he felt himself borne<br>up. He landed with a thud in a truck and was off.<br><br>Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair. It had been a very rough<br>weekend. She had to remember not to drink like that. Bill had been nice about<br>it though. After it was over he'd said he still respected her and, after all,<br>it was certainly the way of nature, and even though, no he didn't love her, he<br>did feel an affection for her. And after all, they were grown adults. Oh, what<br>Bill could teach Waldo - but that seemed many years ago.<br><br>Sheila Klein, her very, very best friend, walked in through the porch screen<br>door and into the kitchen. 'Oh gawd, it's absolutely maudlin outside.' 'Ach, I<br>know what you mean, I feel all icky!' Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton<br>robe with the silk outer edge. Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on<br>the kitchen table, licked her finger and made a face. 'I'm supposed to be<br>taking these salt pills, but,' she wrinkled her nose, 'they make me feel like<br>throwing up.' Marsha started to pat herself under the chin, an exercise she'd<br>seen on television. 'God, don't even talk about that.' She got up from the<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue<br>vitamins. 'Want one? Supposed to be better than steak,' and then attempted to<br>touch her knees. 'I don't think I'll ever touch a daiquiri again.'<br><br>She gave up and sat down, this time nearer the small table that supported the<br>telephone. 'Maybe Bill'll call,' she said to Sheila's glance. Sheila nibbled on<br>a cuticle. 'After last night, I thought maybe you'd be through with him.' 'I<br>know what you mean. My God, he was like an octopus. Hands all over the place.'<br>She gestured, raising her arms upwards in defense. 'The thing is, after a<br>while, you get tired of fighting with him, you know, and after all I didn't<br>really do anything Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him. You know<br>what I mean.' She started to scratch. Sheila was giggling with her hand over<br>her mouth. 'I'll tell you, I felt the same way, and even after a while,' here<br>she bent forward in a whisper, 'I wanted to!' Now she was laughing very loudly.<br><br>It was at this point that Mr. Jameson of the Clarence Darrow Post Office rang<br>the doorbell of the large stucco colored frame house. When Marsha Bronson<br>opened the door, he helped her carry the package in. He had his yellow and his<br>green slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had<br>gotten out of her mother's small beige pocketbook in the den. 'What do you<br>think it is?' Sheila asked. Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back.<br>She stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living<br>room. 'I dunno.'<br><br>Inside the package, Waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the<br>muffled voices. Sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down<br>the center of the carton. 'Why don't you look at the return address and see who<br>it's from?' Waldo felt his heart beating. He could feel the<br>vibrating footsteps. It would be soon.<br><br>Marsha walked around the carton and read the ink-scratched label. 'Ah, god,<br>it's from Waldo!' 'That schmuck!' said Sheila. Waldo trembled with expectation.<br>'Well, you might as well open it,' said Sheila. Both of them tried to lift the<br>staple flap. 'Ah sst,' said Marsha, groaning, 'he must have nailed it shut.'<br>They tugged on the flap again. 'My God, you need a power drill to get this<br>thing open!' They pulled again. 'You can't get a grip.' They both stood still,<br>breathing heavily.<br><br>'Why don't you get a scissor,' said Sheila. Marsha ran into the kitchen, but<br>all she could find was a little sewing scissor. Then she remembered that her<br>father kept a collection of tools in the basement. She ran downstairs, and when<br>she came back up, she had a large sheet metal cutter<br>in her hand. 'This is the best I could find.' She was very out of breath.<br>'Here, you do it. I-I'm gonna die.' She sank into a large fluffy couch and<br>exhaled noisily. Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the<br>end of the cardboard flap, but the blade was too big and there wasn't enough<br>room. 'God damn this thing!' she said feeling very exasperated. Then smiling,<br>'I got an idea.' 'What?' said Marsha. 'Just watch,' said Sheila, touching her<br>finger to her head.<br><br>Inside the package, Waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could<br>barely breathe. His skin felt prickly from the heat, and he could feel his<br>heart beating in his throat. It would be soon. Sheila stood quite upright and<br>walked around to the other side of the package. Then she sank down to her<br>knees, grasped the cutter by both handles, took a deep breath, and plunged the<br>long blade through the middle of the package, through the masking tape, through<br>the cardboard, through the cushioning and (thud) right through the center of<br>Waldo Jeffers head, which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs of red<br>to pulsate gently in the morning sun.<br><br>
