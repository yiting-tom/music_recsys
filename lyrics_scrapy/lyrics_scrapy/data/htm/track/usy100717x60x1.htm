'Cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now<br><br>Yeah, let me explain just how to make greatness<br>Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break you down<br>Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake I'm 'bout<br>To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows<br>If I press the issue just to get the anger out (blllt)<br>Full magazine could take Staples out<br>Savage but ain't thinking 'bout no bank account<br>But bitch I'm off the chain like Taylor Brown<br>Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch<br>I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'<br>My talent? Oh, bitch I don't know who the fuck y'all are<br>To give a sub-par bar<br>Even have an opinion if you, you mention me<br>Millions of views, attention the news<br>I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you<br>Billions of views, your ten cents are two<br>Skim through the music to give a shit reviews<br>To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse<br>Don't get misconstrued, business as us'<br>Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do<br>Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listening t-to<br>Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow<br>Everyone copies though? Probably no<br>Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adios<br>I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though<br>Not even dissin', it just ain't for me<br>All I am simply is just an emcee<br>Maybe 'Stan' just isn't your cup of tea<br>Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean<br>Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably shake the world up if it were up to me<br>Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill<br>I should eat a pill, probably I will<br>Old me kill the new me, watch him bleed to death<br>I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath<br>Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed<br>Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, but spelled)<br>Jam a Crest white strip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick<br>Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence<br>Bang it with a pipe wrench<br>While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch<br>Like vice-president Mike Pence<br>Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip<br>These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic<br>Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and<br>Jesus Christ man, how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)<br>You will never see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C<br>I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze<br>And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it<br>Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)<br>Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough<br>Nah, turn the valium up<br>'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut now<br>When it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at<br>I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks you'll just turn around and just be like<br>'Man, how the fuck sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks and now he wants to take it out on us?' (ooh-ooh)<br>But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy of The Mathers LP to tell me to study<br>It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooh-ooh)<br>I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that<br>I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry<br>Especially an effing Recovery clone of me<br>So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Iggy 'zae<br>Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne<br>I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name<br>I'm fed up with being humble<br>And rumor is I'm hungry<br>I'm sure you heard bumblings<br>I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach<br>I heard your mumbling but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo<br>The era that I'm from will pummel you<br>That's what it's comin' to<br>What the fuck are you gonna do, where you runnin' to?<br>I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two<br>And dump on you if you ain't Joyner<br>If you ain't Kendrick or Cole<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>Or Sean then you're a goner<br>I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it<br>I guess when you walk into BK, you expect a Whopper<br>You can order a quarter pounder when you go to McDonald's<br>But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival<br>But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider<br>Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned and you would have bought it<br>But sayin' I no longer got it 'cause you missed the line and never caught it<br>'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it<br>'Cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest<br>With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist<br>And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be, regardless<br>What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest<br>Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it<br>Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic<br>With a bottle full of malt liquor<br>But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer<br>The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom if I don't<br>Pull myself from the jaws of defeat<br>And rise to my feet<br>I don't see why y'all even started with me<br>I get impeached<br>My enemies die<br>I don't ceasefire till at least all are deceased<br>I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'<br>Now you see why I don't sleep<br>Not even a wink, I don't blink<br>I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats<br>I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze<br>'Aw, man!<br>That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage<br>The Thing ain't even orange<br>Oh my God, that's a reach'<br>Shout to all my colorblind people<br>Each and every one of y'all<br>If you call a fire engine green, aquamarine<br>Or you think water is pink<br>'Dawg, that's a date'<br>'Looks like an olive to me'<br>'Look, there's an apple'<br>'No it's not, it's a peach!'<br>So finger-bang, Pootie Tang, Burger King, Gucci Gang, [?]<br>Charlamagne gonna hate anyway<br>Doesn't matter what I say<br>Give me Donkey of the Day<br>What a way for 2018 to get underway<br>But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say<br>Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)<br>Invite them in like a one a day<br>I'm not done (preach)<br>'Cause I feel like the beast of burden<br>That line in the sand, was it even worth it?<br>'Cause the way I see people turnin'<br>Is makin' it seem worthless<br>It's startin' to defeat the purpose<br>I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds<br>And I was just trying to do the right thing, but word<br>Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict<br>Or still yet to be determined?<br>'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship<br>But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it<br>And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he's deserted<br>But I think it's workin'<br>These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous<br>And he's too scared to answer me with words<br>'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered<br>But I know at least he's heard it<br>'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service<br>To meet in person<br>To see if I really think of hurtin' him<br>Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists<br>I said, 'Only when it comes to ink and lyricists'<br>But my beef is more media journalists<br>(Hold up, hold up, hold up)<br>I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist<br>They can get a mouthful of flesh<br>And yes, I mean eating a penis<br>'Cause they been panning my album to death<br>So I been giving the media fingers<br>Don't wanna turn this to a counselling sesh<br>But they been puttin' me through the ringer<br>So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press<br>But I just took this beat to the cleaners<br><br><br><br><ol><li> Special thanks to  <strong><font color="#638DC0">More OG</font> </strong>  for correcting the lyric.</li></ol>
