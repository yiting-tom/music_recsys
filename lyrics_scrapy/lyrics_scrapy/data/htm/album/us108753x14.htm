<br>
<br>
   The new album The Heart of Everything from Within Temptation was released on the 9th of March in the Netherlands, and was released on the 24th of July in the United States. The release dates for multiple countries are found on their official Myspace page. Two more tracks, 'The Howling' and 'Sounds of Freedom', were recorded as promotion material for the video game 'The Chronicles of Spellborn', and the first of these opens the album. The full track listing was revealed on the 10th of January.[12] The band embarked on their first North American tour with Lacuna Coil in May to promote the North American release of the album. Roadrunner Records also released a limited edition EP called The Howling (EP), which was available only at Hot Topic stores.<br><br>The album debuted at #1 in the Dutch Album 100, making it their second number-one album. It's also the first time a Dutch act ever charted within the United World Chart. It peaked at #38 selling 50,000 copies in their first week. It reached top 10 in eight countries and top 100 in eleven countries. As of March 30, 2007 the album has sold 150,000 copies.<br><br>The song 'What Have You Done' was the first single released from the album. Its music video was recorded on the 12th, 13th, and 14th of December in 2006 at the Koko club in London, and a CGI studio in Windsor. It features Keith Caputo of Life of Agony fame on guest vocals. Fans were allowed to participate in the making of the video, although this first version left the band feeling disappointed (comments made by the band at their March show in Lyon). Shortly after, a completely new video for the song was made. The song peaked at #7 in the Netherlands and #4 in Finland.<br><br>The second single, released across Europe in June, was 'Frozen'. The video, filmed in Romania, deals with child abuse, and sales of the single will raise money for a children's charity, Child Helpline International. 'The Howling' was chosen as a digital single release for the UK, and another video was also shot. The extended version of the 'Frozen' single features an unreleased b-side, 'Sounds Of Freedom', a second song written for computer game 'The Chronicles of Spellborn'.<br><br>Within Temptation started their very first US tour a few months after the European release of The Heart of Everything, supporting Lacuna Coil, and appearing alongside In This Moment, Stolen Babies, The Gathering, and Kylesa. The tour, dubbed The Hottest Chicks in Metal Tour 2007, was largely a success.<br><br>The Heart of Everything was released in the U.S. on July 24, and the promotional single of 'What Have You Done' shipped to rock stations July 2nd.[citation needed]<br><br>In support of the new album, Within Temptation decided to kick off their first headlining US tour in Fall 2007. The band plans to play thirteen shows, starting on September 5, 2007 in Boston and ending on September 23, 2007 in Tempe, Arizona.<br><br>On October 19, 2007, Within Temptation release their video for their third single 'All I Need'. The single is expected to be release in Europe on November 5 and features the single and album versions of the title track plus demo versions of 'The Last Time', 'Frozen' and 'Our Solemn Hour'[13].
