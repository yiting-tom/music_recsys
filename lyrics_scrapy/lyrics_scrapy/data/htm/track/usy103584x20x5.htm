Life is too short<br>I play the bitches like it's a sport<br>Yeah, I'll play the bitches just like y'all<br>Like Dr. J played basketball<br><br>You can call me Too, don't say it twice<br>You'll get me real mad and I'll fuck your wife<br>You see I'm not proper, I'm rarely polite<br>Too Short, Too Short, don't say it tonight<br><br>It started on a bright morning in 1987<br>I was in my drop-to Caddy y'all gettin sucked by a bitch named Helen<br>Nasty bitches, around the world, I wrote this rhyme for you<br>You might not like my rap, but I'm tellin you bitch it's true<br><br>So much death in the Oakland streets am I gonna live till next week?<br>Will I get shot by a dope fiend, tryin to get high, tryin to steal my ring<br>I really can't say, 'cause I don't know why<br>People out here droppin' dead like flies<br><br>I used to see a home boy givin' five<br>Now I say, 'Man, you still alive?'<br>Cold as hell, the town I'm from<br>Won't last too long when you're fakin' the funk<br><br>I'm the master rapper, so unique<br>Clap my hand when I want my freak<br>You can't deny it, you know I'm right<br>I turn any rapper out when I'm on the mic<br><br>And I won't kick back or relax<br>Till he knows I'm the best at the MC rap<br>Till he knows Too Short, set the track<br>They got him caught up in my serious cap<br><br>Motherfucker can't spit straight game on the mic<br>'Cause he's worse than a fag or a Frisco dike<br>He's a sucker MC, I call him punk<br>You try to spit that rap, you can scratch that junk<br><br>You little punk-ass boy, wouldn't listen to me<br>Think I'm fakin' but I'm takin all you sucker MC's<br>To the end of the world and push you over<br>Good luck couldn't find you in a four leaf clover<br><br>If I ever said a rap, tryin to cap on you<br>I wouldn't even sweat it cause you'll be through<br>Lookin so far up, you might fall down<br>Gettin clowned by the hound from east Oaktown<br><br>And the look in your face when you're lickin' that tooth<br>Could make a grown man die, laughin' at you<br>'Cause you're a, no rappin', no rhymin'<br>Played out fake ass simple Simon<br><br>I never understood one word you said<br>But you're swearin' up and down that you're killin' 'em dead<br>There's only one thing, I wanted to know<br>Sucker motherfucker, where's the joke?<br><br>I'm the player of players, just call me Pop<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>My name is Too Short, no I don't stop<br>I just don't stop mackin', don't stop cappin'<br>Don't stop rappin' now you see what happens<br><br>Your mind is gone, your crew just cut<br>Sucker MC I'll tell you what<br>Your rhymes are weak, your rap the same<br>And when it comes to game, you are lame<br><br>Never even heard of Too Short baby<br>Hit Oakland in 1980<br>Singin more raps than a rap could rhyme<br>Tellin sucker MC's don't waste my time<br><br>There's a girl I know her name is Betty<br>Straight to the head just rock it steady<br>She's so freaky she'll juice you up<br>All the home boys just can't get enough<br><br>She's a Ph.D. don't even stop<br>In the back like that goin top, top, top<br>I won't say white girl, won't say she's black<br>She's the kind of girl that make your knees go crack<br><br>Feel the beat, rock with me<br>Let me tell you what I be<br>I'm a MC rapper, a MC rapper<br>A big bank roller and a cold, cold capper<br><br>Hey baby, I got this rhyme<br>It's not gonna stop till the end of time<br>Like rock and roll I'll play that song<br>To the beat all day and all night long<br><br>So liten up, to what I'm sayin'<br>I'm a Oaktown mack, bitch I ain't playin'<br>To all the home boys doin time in the pen<br>Gonna rock this beat for you once again<br><br>If you can't get out and you're mad as hell<br>Say beeatch, now make it sound for real<br>I'ma tear shit up, if I get the chance<br>I could give a fuck less if you're hole don't dance<br><br>See I'm a big mack now, I'm so great<br>I was born and raised in the Golden State<br>Call me T O O, if you say Short<br>I'ma rap my ass off till you give me some more<br><br>Big bank, now just make me rich<br>Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch make me rich<br>Check out my style, baby I don't quit<br>I heard this freak say, 'That's the shit'<br><br>He took the cake, fucked the rake<br>Too Short baby damn sure ain't fake<br>But the sucker MC's are screamin' loud<br>Sayin' Sir Too Short, shut your mouth<br><br>How can you talk about me, and call me weak<br>When your father smokes coke and you mother's a freak<br>So I keep on rappin, if nothin else<br>Keep your jealous's thoughts to yourself<br><br>Bitch he's a MC right<br>Ain't sayin' nothin' but he's holdin' the mic<br>Fuck with me, and boy you're doomed<br>I send a trick with a hoe to the motel room<br><br>Cause I'm the coldest MC on a microphone<br>Like a .357 pointed at your dome<br>I got cap for cap, you never heard<br>So fresh again with cusswords<br><br>Motherfuckin' shit, fuckin with me<br>Fuck a skank bitch and a sucker MC<br>All you bastards got the claps<br>And fuck you punk, 'cause you still can't rap<br><br>Cusswords, just let 'em know<br>Motherfuckin shit, god damn ass hoe<br>Cusswords, just don't quit<br>Motherfuck you damn shithead bitch<br>It's Too Short, on the mic, and it don't stop<br>And it don't stop, and it won't stop,<br><br>Beeatch<br>Check out my style<br><br>
