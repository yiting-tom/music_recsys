RYAN DOMINGUEZ – vocals, guitar JOSH LURIE – guitar CHRIS POULSEN – bass TOM ROSLAK – drums<br><br>It’s amazing what kind of change a couple of years of experience can bring to an up-and-coming act — just ask Jersey-based Tokyo Rose. In 2003, the melodic punk quartet entered the market with their upbeat, energetic debut, Reinventing a Lost Art. Though the album served its purpose rather well, the foursome found some room for improvement and acted quickly, redefining their musical vision. The result is New American Saint, out on SideCho this October. But being able to envision, draft and eventually create New American Saint came only after years of laborious input. Vocalist/guitarist Ryan Dominguez and bassist Chris Poulsen had met while students at Rutgers University in New Jersey and helped Tokyo Rose launch on a much smaller scale; the pair wedged the act’s performance schedule between midterms, classes and homework. 'We toured whenever we could during breaks,' Poulsen, recalls. Upon their graduation, Tokyo Rose became the members’ main focus and the band soon found a home with Orange County-based SideCho Records. It was then that Tokyo Rose, whose members were barely in their twenties at the time, recorded their debut album, Reinventing a Lost Art. After the debut’s release, Tokyo Rose hit the touring circuit with bands like The Militia Group’s The Lyndsay Diaries, and also made an appearance at the CMJ festival that same year. 2004 brought more activity, including a South By Southwest performance and a healthy 30-date stint on the Warped Tour. After another round of touring with Over It and a trip to Japan in early 2005, Tokyo Rose found themselves back at work on their sophomore effort. Tokyo Rose demoed their new album and opted for producer Matt Goldman, whom they had selected because of his contributions to Copeland’s efforts. 'We just heard really good things about him and liked everything that we heard that he did,' says Poulsen. Trekking it south to Atlanta, the band spent roughly a month with Goldman and the end result was the incredible New American Saint. Infusing a host of new influences outside their traditional genre boundaries, Tokyo Rose’s sophomore effort offers an array of additional instrumentation and pristine, yet comfortable production. 'We wanted to go for a different feel than what we had done in the past,' says Poulsen. Yet, that doesn’t mean Tokyo Rose ditched its melodic rock foundation. The more mature and focused New American Saint simply expands upon the stable base of the band’s debut. Key tracks include the catchy, motivated 'Goodbye Almond Eyes,' which talks about failed relationships and, according to Poulsen, 'about someone who can’t make up their mind on ending a relationship. They just keep dragging things out.' Even Tokyo Rose’s approach to reaching out to new listeners has also changed. 'There was no MySpace a few years ago. We’re definitely trying to reach out to people and keep it as personal as possible,' says Poulsen. 'We’re two years wiser. We’ve made some mistakes but we’ve also done good things that we’ve remembered. We’ll do this right. People actually know our name and that was the first step. Now we’ve got to take advantage of those things and use it to reach more people to become a better and bigger band.'
