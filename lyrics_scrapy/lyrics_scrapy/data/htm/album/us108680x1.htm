<br>
<br>
   Referred to by both the media and his fans as a prophet, innovator, and poet, the emcee widely known as Killah Priest is widely recognized as one of the most vivid lyricists in Hip Hop. Priest (as he prefers being called now) first entranced listeners on the classic track B.I.B.L.E. (Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth) on GZAs seminal debut LP Liquid Swords, Priest has continued to enthrall devotees of true Hip Hop with his lush imagery, graphic storytelling and razor-sharp rhymes.<br><br>Born Walter Reed and raised in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, he began immersing himself in spiritual discovery and the acquisition of knowledge long before he touched a microphone, spending long hours studying religion and history as a child and a teen. He fondly recalls initiating impromptu Bible study sessions and Ancient History lessons on the streets of Brooklyn while he was still in high school. That early exposure and continuing education- interwoven with his personal experiences in his Bed-Stuy projects- still resonates in his lyrics today.<br><br>His childhood friendships with Wu-Tang's GZA and Onyx's Suave exposed him to pursuing music as a career. His mesmerizing wordplay on B.I.B.L.E. prompted Geffen Records to offer him a recording contract. That resulting album - Heavy Mental, remains a by all a hip hop classic<br><br>Priest's appearance on Red Hot organization's 6th AIDS charity album 'America Is Dying Slowly' (Priest created the title's acronym) further established him as one of the most respected voices and visionaries in Hip Hop. His stature is evident in the company he keeps, having recorded and/or performed with music legends both within and outside of Hip Hop (George Clinton, Big Daddy Kane, Earth Wind and Fire, KRS-One, Wyclef Jean, Elephant Man, and DJ Spooky) and appearing on the 2003 Led Zeppelin tribute album Stairway To Rock alongside Quincy Jones, Carlos Santana, Stevie Wonder, Alanis Morisette, Metallica and Slash.<br><br>Priest's 2nd, 3rd and 4th albums, 'View From Masada' (released on MCA which heavily featured production by then-unknown producer Just Blaze), 'Priesthood' (released on his own Proverbs Records) and 'Black August' (Recon) all garnered excellent reviews.<br><br>His latest outing, the highly anticipated 'The Offering', is undoubtedly his greatest work yet and features an exciting lineup of collaborators both on production and on the mic. 'The Offering' is finshed and ready to go!<br><br>
