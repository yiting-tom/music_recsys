<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
The Roys hit the ground running ever since the release of their first Rural Rhythm album, Lonesome Whistle, in 2011 which debuted at Number 7 on the Billboard Top 10 Bluegrass Album chart and included two chart topping singles and popular music videos with Coal Minin Man and Trailblazer .<br>2012 has been a very busy year for The Roys who are currently on tour with recent performances at the C M A Music Festival and many numerous festivals and concerts around the country. They have recently made two national TV appearances including RFD TV's Reno's Old Time Music Festival and the PBS Special, Pa's Fiddle America's Music and are releasing their new Rural Rhythm album New Day Dawning.<br>This much anticipated follow up album contains 7 new songs including the first single Still Standing an inspirational song about finding strength during difficult times written by Lee And Elaine Roy. Following the success of Lonesome Whistle is a challenge, but we are very excited about this new music. We hope these songs will expand our listener base as well as continue to take our current listeners on our musical journey. Lee Roy<br>In addition to their own outstanding songwriting on the new album, Lee and Elaine have called upon some of the finest songwriters today to help them co-write on New Day Dawning including Brandon Rickman, Jenee Fleenor, Steve Dean, Mark Houser, Jay Brunswick, Larry Alderman and Brian White.<br><br>Faith, music and family are the cornerstones of The Roys life and they all come together again, much like on their debut album, on New Day Dawning. This combination of influences has surely helped them achieve recent award success; 2010, 2009 Inspirational Country Music (I C M) Duo of The Year and 2011 Inspirational Country Music (I C M) Bluegrass Artist of the Year.<br><br>2011 And 2012 have been great years for The Roys and with their new album New Day Dawning they will be making many new fans as they expand their fan base through this new music, bigger concert venues and much more TV exposure.
