<br>
From the bottom there is only one place to look...upward. From the pit comes opportunity for new plateaus. And from a place of seeming hopelessness a chance for inspiration results, a chance to defy the odds and rise again.<br><br>Phoenix is our rebirth, frontman and songwriter Matt MacDonald reflects. Conceptually, it's about the time spent in the ashes, between death and this new life, wondering if we d ever get out. The whole process has restored our hope in the value of what we do. Our Kickstarter backers have restored our confidence that we are not alone and that there is still work to be done.<br><br>TCC has always been known for their ability to meld accessibility with experimentation. With a singular sound, they have always rested somewhere between pop/rock, emo, indie, and post-hardcore. On Phoenix, the band has honed this balance to perfection, with every element of their array of artistry on full display; Phoenix comes complete with singular instrumentation, unparalleled emotion, and uncanny melody. But the element which makes this new release soar above their catalogue is the spirit of reawakening that came as a result of partnering directly with their fans.<br><br>I think we're less afraid to do what we want this time around, MacDonald explains. We were less afraid to do things that wouldn t sound perfect live, to dream up parts that maybe we wouldn t have previously because we may have been afraid to try it. The comfort of knowing our fans have our back brought out our best efforts, and our deepest creativity. I can t stress that enough. Knowing that they are behind us, we felt completely rejuvenated and reborn.<br><br>After raising the funds necessary to deliver a record that was up to the high sonic standards of their previous efforts, TCC embarked on a journey into uncharted waters; MacDonald wore not only songwriting and vocal hats this time around, but the production hat as well. And for very good reason-this allowed the band the extra time necessary to make the record the best it could possibly be.<br><br>I had an extra two months to work on vocals and programming, which is unheard of in a normal recording situation. One of the reasons I produced the album is because I wanted to sit with the songs as the parts marinated so I could add more when I was inspired to. We couldn't have done it if we booked 4 weeks with another producer, because we would have been on a schedule and would have been saying Good enough, let s move on much more than I'd like to.<br><br>Ultimately, Phoenix is therapy; therapy for The Classic Crime, therapy for MacDonald and hopefully, therapy for all those who face a hopeless scenario in their lives. It is the medicine that many need an honest record from an honest, fearless band with genuine supporters.<br><br>Music has been a way for me to name my struggles over the past few years, and the best way for me to heal is to hear these songs done, and to know exactly what I felt when I wrote them. It's also so meaningful to know that somebody out there might feel the same way and use my words to articulate their own struggle... it's just powerful stuff. Music is a personal thing for me, so I'll always write songs, but it's also magic in a sense that it connects you on a deep level with the people who hear it. Nothing brings us together like mutual struggle.
