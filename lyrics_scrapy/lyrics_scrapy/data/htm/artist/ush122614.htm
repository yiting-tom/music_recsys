<dd class="hb0">The Beauty of Gemina is a Swiss electronic/alternative rock band founded by Michael Sele in 2006.<br><br>History<br><br>The Beauty of Gemina was started after the dissolution of Michael Sele's old band, Nuuk. On their debut album, the song 'Suicide Landscape' became a number one hit on the World Gothic Charts. For this song, a video was shot at the San Bernardino Pass which was played on VIVA (MTV Europe) and put into rotation on Schweizer Fernsehen.<br><br>In the spring of 2008, they were the supporting act for The Smashing Pumpkins in the Zurich Hallenstadion. In May, they played at Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig. After a tour with the German rock band ASP and some concerts in England, they completed their second album A Stranger to Tears. It was released in Switzerland under their own label tBoG Music, and in Austria and Germany with Danse Macabre Records, the label of Bruno Kramm of Das Ich. The video for the song 'This Time' was again aired on VIVA Switzerland and Schweizer Fernsehen. The album hit number three on the Deutsche Alternative Charts. In both 2011 and 2012, they were in Hildesheim to play at the M'era Luna festival.<br>Musical style<br><br>The band mixes elements from electronic rock, dark rock, metal and electronic music. Classical elements are integrated into many songs, thus one finds a sample from a Mozart composition in 'Victims of Love' from their first album. Influences include techno/trance ('Victims of Love', 'Shadow Dancer' and 'Galilee Song') and gothic rock/dark wave (guitar on 'This Time') that could already be seen in Michael Sele's predecessor band Nuuk.<br><br>For their third album At The End Of The Sea, The Beauty of Gemina added more guitars to the foreground, including new wave and post-punk sounds of the 1980s (for example, in 'Obscura', 'Rumours' and 'Narcotica') and alternative rock riffs from the 1990s in such songs as 'Black Cat Nights' and 'Counting Tears'. However, their music still features the fusion of different genres of rock and electronic dance music. For instance, 'King's Men Come', 'Narcotica' and 'La Mer – Rythme Eternel' have breakbeat and trip hop rhythms, while 'In Silence' features a typical techno beat from a Roland TR-909 bass drum.<br>Lyrics<br><br>Michael Sele's lyrics deal with issues such as suicide, depression, loneliness and heartache. He has also criticized the Catholic Church, specifically by releasing the songs 'Victims of Love' and 'Galilee Song' as free downloads during Easter 2009. A significant feature of most songs by The Beauty of Gemina is the amount of repetition in the text. Songs with the traditional style of verse and chorus are rare.<br>Discography<br>Albums<br><br>    Diary of a Lost (2006)<br>    A Stranger to Tears (2008)<br>    At the End of the Sea (2010)<br>    Iscariot Blues (2012)<br>    The Myrrh Sessions (2013)<br>    Ghost Prayers (2014)<br>    Minor Sun (2016)</dd>
