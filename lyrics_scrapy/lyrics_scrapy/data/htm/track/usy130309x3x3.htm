<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> Justified</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>Lyricist：Smokie Norful<br><br>I was preaching a sermon one Sunday and uh<br>It was about, it was a parable<br>And it was talking about the uh, the disciples and Jesus<br>When they were going through a corn field<br>And they began to pick the corn<br><br>And the Pharisees, the legalistics of the day, they came<br>And they were chastising them that<br>'Why are you doing this on the Sabbath?'<br><br>They had this whole discourse and dialog between the two of them<br>Jesus was saying, 'Listen, do you, do you not remember that you<br>You, yourself aren't even worthy<br>You guys break unleavened  bread on, on the Sabbath<br>And you kill the sacrifice, you clean the sacrifice'<br><br>They have a need and it's my job and my responsibility<br>To meet their need and I'm at their need<br>I trump the synagogue, I trump the Sabbath<br>I'm lowered of your life, I'm lowered of everything that is you<br>I'm lowered of this, this day, recognize who you're talking to<br><br>But in the course of the whole thing what I realize is that<br>The dialog was between the Pharisees or the religious leaders of the day<br>Was between the dignitaries, the officials of the Church and Jesus<br>The disciples never uttered a word<br><br>He literally started embodying his permanent position in our lives<br>Because he stepped in between the law and the people<br>He says, 'No, I'm Grace and because of Me<br>They don't have to defend themselves to you'<br><br>'I'll do all the talking, My blood will speak through all of eternity<br>I have justified them, even in their wrong, I know that they are wrong<br>I know that they make mistakes, I know that they are not perfect<br>I know that they do things that are not pleasing'<br><br>'But even in their wrong, My blood will speak on their behalf<br>And I will just', somebody should have shouted right there<br>Because He didn't kill you for all the sinful acts that you committed<br>But he justified you<br><br>God bless me with this song, it simply speaks the life of that message<br>And I'm just excited to be able to share it with you<br><br>Hey, justified me, glorified me<br>Paid my ransom and I've been redeemed by his blood<br>Go to Calvary, I've been made free<br>Despite my enemy, I thank God, I'm justified<br><br>Paid a price for my life<br>And all that was wrong, His love made it right<br>Now what greater sign can any man show?<br>That know with his own blood He made me whole<br><br>He justified me, glorified me<br>Paid my ransom and I've been redeemed by his blood<br>Go to calvary, I've been made free<br>Despite my enemy, I thank God, I'm justified<br><br>If my sins had their way I never would have made it<br>With a debt I just couldn't afford to pay, He came and saved me<br>When the enemy said that I couldn't, God said go ahead<br>Because you're covered by me awesome, awesome powerful blood<br><br>Though I, I should've been dead and never kept alive<br>God's grace and his mercy were on every side<br>When it looks like I can't, God says I can<br>And he won't let me fall in the enemy's hand<br><br>Oh, I'm just glad to know that God saved me<br>His grace and his mercy<br>They watched over me all night long<br>If it had not been, if it had not been<br>If it had not been, if it had not been<br>If it had not been for the lord that was on my side<br>Hey, listen I got some testimonies listen<br><br>Just like Nineveh that was headed for destruction<br>God stepped in and he said<br>(Not guilt)<br>You gonna live and you won't see the day of destruction<br>  (Oh oh oh)<br><br>Just like Daniel who was condemned to the lion's den, God said<br>(Not guilt)<br>You're gonna live<br>  (You're gonna live, yeah)<br><br>Just like David who was dearly beloved inspite of God said<br>(Not guilt)<br>Yeah<br>Hey<br>(Let's talk about you)<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br><br>If you be honest with yourself tonight<br>If it hadn't been for the grace of God<br>You would've been, you could've been<br>Yeah, listen, hey<br><br>To the liar<br>(Not guilt)<br>To the cheater<br>(Not guilt)<br><br>To the deceiver<br>(Not guilt)<br>Even to the believer<br>(Not guilt)<br><br>There is their point no condemnation to them<br>(Not guilt)<br>That are in Christ Jesus<br>(Not guilt)<br><br>Yeah, yeah<br>(Not guilt)<br>Hey<br><br>Some of y'all got it twisted, listen<br>(Not guilt)<br>If it hadn't been for God<br>(God did it)<br><br>You wouldn't have made it<br>Hey, don't get confused about who kept you<br>Hey<br>(God did it)<br><br>When the enemy said that I couldn't, God did it<br>(God did it)<br>When my haters said that I wouldn't, God did it<br>(God did it)<br><br>Hey, I thought we'd never get out of the poor house but<br>(God did it)<br>I thought we'd never see the White House but I'm claiming it<br>(God did it)<br><br>Hey and if you be honest He's been over your house<br>(God did it)<br>Every grateful heart just bless his name<br>(God did it)<br><br>Who delivered you?<br>(God did it)<br>Be honest about it, who kept you? Yeah<br>(God did it)<br><br>Come on and testify who brought you, hey<br>(God did it)<br>Hey, just shout God did it<br>(God did it)<br><br>Point to heaven and give him glory, God did it<br>(God did it)<br>Come on and testify, hey<br>(God did it)<br><br>One more time if your praise is ringing say God did it<br>(God did it)<br>Hey yeah, yeah, hey<br>(God did it)<br><br>Every time I turn around, it's but God<br>But God, but God, but God<br>They said I wouldn't but God<br>They said I couldn't but God<br>They say I should've been dead but God<br>They say I should've been sick but God<br>They said I should've have never made it but God, yeah<br><br>Come on and just shout God did it<br>(God did it)<br>God did it<br>(God did it)<br><br>God did it<br>(God did it)<br>God did it<br>(God did it)<br><br>Don't believe yourself<br>(God did it)<br>Like your grateful self<br>(God did it)<br>Yeah, everybody say<br>(God did it)<br><br>
