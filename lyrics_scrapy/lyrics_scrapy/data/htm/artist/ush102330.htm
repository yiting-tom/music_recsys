<dd class="hb0">Models are a rock group formed in Melbourne, Australia, in August 1978 and went into hiatus in 1988. They are often referred to as 'The Models' (Mark Ferrie refers to 'The Models' in his work bio for example). They re-formed in 2000, 2006 and 2008 to perform reunion concerts. 'Out of Mind, Out of Sight', their only No. 1 hit, appeared on the Australian singles charts in July 1985. The related album, Out of Mind, Out of Sight, peaked at No. 3 on the Australian albums charts after its release in August. Out of Mind, Out of Sight appeared on the Billboard 200 albums chart, with the single, 'Out of Mind, Out of Sight', peaking at No. 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. An earlier song from the same album, 'Barbados', had peaked at No. 2 on the Australian singles chart.<br><br>Models early line-up included Andrew Duffield on keyboards, Mark Ferrie on bass guitar, Janis Freidenfelds (a.k.a. Johnny Crash) on drums and percussion, and Sean Kelly on vocals and lead guitar. A later line-up was mainstay Kelly on guitar, James Freud on vocals and bass, Roger Mason on keyboards, Barton Price on drums, and James Valentine on saxophone. Backing singers in the group included Zan Abeyratne and Kate Ceberano (both from I'm Talking) and Canadian-born Wendy Matthews. In early 1989, Duffield, Kelly, Matthews and Valentine were members of Absent Friends. On 27 October 2010, Models were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame by Matthews.</dd>
