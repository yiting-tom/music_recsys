I cried<br>Madame Maria said, 'Well, I had a notion<br>So before you came in, I prepared half a potion<br><br>Now you must do the other half<br>I wrote you a list<br>You must get seven part-silver curses made special out of bullet bits by some Pollock I know in Evergreen Park<br>And dip them in the potion and drop them in Buckingham Fountain at 3:13 on Friday morning<br>And then she'll be gone, you'll be rid of her!'<br><br>Quick, for the potion, we have to get three dozen crabapples that fell off a raggedy old tree right in the southwestern corner of Columbus Park!<br>Faster, we have to go up to Caputo's Produce and Fruit Market on Harlem and get the garden snake that lives in the banana bin!<br>Hurry, we have to get the mercury out of the old thermometer they have through the north-facing doors<br>To the left by the shoe-shine boys in the lobby of the Monadnock building!<br>And don't be late, for you must get the silver out of the teeth of one George Karmalitis<br>Who as we speak lies dead under a dirty wool blanket in the basement of the morgue of Laretto hospital<br>The silver teeth of a man killed by a jealous wife!<br><br>I wasn't always an old maid<br>I didn't always walk down the street<br>And have the children yell at me Spinny Spinny the Spinster<br>And try to knock the hat off my head<br>I had a fiancee, or he led me to believe I'd soon be his fiancee<br>And I did believe him, as I had every right to<br>And I'd put on my best dress and we'd go dance at all the dances<br><br>And I'd never let the boys from the barracks cut in<br>They'd come out of Great Lakes, usually straight off the farm anyway<br>And I'd never really let any of the country club beaus get a chance<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>Those cream-colored summer suits were never cut to my taste anyhow<br>And those Hyde Park fraternity fellas were out as a matter of course<br>I don't enjoy a man in red, so certainly not maroon, that's for sure<br><br>I only had eyes for my guy, see<br>But one night he had said he wouldn't be able to take me<br>As he hurt his shoulder and had his arm in a sling<br>But I went anyway and saw him with another woman<br>And she was wearing his ring<br><br>The silver still smelled and smelted down quick into the copper or lead or whatever else it was<br>And when the metal was still soft and hot you'd engrave the curse into it with a stylus from an old whale bone<br>I thought for a second of what I might write<br>Something a little different, but with the correct sort of spite<br>One of them asked panayia mou to make that blonde's hair fall straight out<br>The potion was ready back at my apartment<br>And my sister and I mumbled and crossed ourselves when we dropped the curses in<br>And I thought of my husband<br>My husband and her<br>And I thought of me and him, of what we were<br>I thought of our wedding day<br><br>And I was happy, very simply happy<br>Do you hear it<br>A modest young woman's simple contentment<br>It's probably a sunny day, and I think it was<br>The birds were chirping<br>And I felt like I was dancing on air<br>But not very far off the ground<br>I wonder if I knew even then that things wouldn't always be perfect<br>That one day he'd seek solace in the arms of another woman<br>And that to win him back, to win him back, I'd have to do this<br><br>3:11!, 3:12!, 3:13!<br>On a hot August night everyone is asleep<br>But the crows were watching, witching and my temple was twitching<br>Twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch<br>Fountain, sweet fountain<br>Fountain, sweet fountain<br>Let your water react and turn the curses to fact and come true<br>Fountain, sweet fountain<br>Fountain, sweet fountain<br>Let your water react and turn the curses to fact and come true<br>And they do<br><br>The instant we dropped them in, our hearts started to race<br>And a wind came up off the lake; make no mistake, we felt something released out into the city<br>And I swore<br>And I swooned<br>As I swept back somehow to Austin, I don't remember how<br>Scared of what I had wrought<br>But terrified, I didn't get what I had sought<br><br>Oh Jimmy, where you been so long<br>Oh Jimmy, where you been so long<br>Oh Jimmy, where you been so long<br><br>Oh Jimmy, where you been so long<br>Oh Jimmy, where you been so long<br>Oh Jimmy, where you been so long<br><br>And as the clock struck eight the next morning<br>My husband was next to me with a smile on his face<br>And I looked, no blond hairs on his pajamas<br>And it was as if I had been awakened from a bad dream<br><br>
