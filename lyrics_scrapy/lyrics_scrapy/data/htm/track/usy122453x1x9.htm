That'll be bad if she was disqualified by her raggedy past<br>And what about the men who knew the habits she has and how in sin, she's at home like a rabbit in grass?<br>No more waiting and contemplating, faith has to be cast like a net.<br>It's like a check it has to be cashed<br>And when it was despite the lack of faith she had, Jesus was glad that she asked<br><br>Just give me the crumbs<br>That's all I need<br>I don't want the lunch<br>I just want a piece<br>Just give me the crumbs<br>That's all for me<br>Cause i'm worthy, unworthy of you<br>Just give me the crumbs<br><br>Luke 7:1-10<br>He was a dude with a voice known for thundering<br>He was a ruler, had a couple boys under him<br>Still he'd come to Him, humbled and wondering if He could help with his partner's health which was crumbling<br>He'd heard with a word, that Jesus could do things<br>Legs that never walked bouncing up like they had new springs, Eyes that never saw, seeing new things,<br>Stuff like that and even stuff flyer than two wings<br>Then he thought of his boy and thought of how his boy was short of time and in order to save him he had to cordia-lly ask the Lord to do something for Him<br>Poor him, but wait, He's busy<br>Would he ignore him?<br>What if He says don't bother me?<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>Probably would if last night He was in the bar with me<br>I'm not worthy to have God with me<br>Jesus speak the word Don't even come to the crib, I've no authority<br><br>Just give me the crumbs<br>That's all I need<br>You don't have to come<br>Just call for me<br>Just give me the crumbs<br>That's all for me<br>Cause i'm worthy, unworthy of you<br>Just give me the crumbs<br><br>Mark 5: 25-34<br>She was a bleeder. Obviously loved by mosquitoes but not relay loved by the leaders<br>Not really loved by the divas, or guys either, with one touch, you butt heads like beavers<br>'Cause when you had a condition, it was written 'Stay away from her' .<br>Getting it in was forbidden<br>It had been so long since she'd gotten hugs,<br>She'd forgotten hugs like hip hop's forgotten loves<br>Then her eyes laid hold of the one who could make whole<br>She said to her soul 'Maybe if I touch the hem of His great robe, His power will revolve on me like fake gold,'<br>Wait whoa!<br>All of her home girl pleading 'Stop!'<br>And Jesus stopped, cause her faith had Jesus rocked<br>These are not cute stories, but these are dropped for all of us who need the same grace the bleeder got<br><br>Just give me the crumbs<br>That's all I need<br>I just want some<br>To stop all the bleeding<br>Just give me the crumbs<br>That's all for me<br>Cause i'm worthy, unworthy of you<br>Just give me the crumbs<br><br>Just give me the crumbs<br>That's all I need<br>Just give me the crumbs<br>That's all I need<br>Just give me the crumbs<br>That's all for me<br>Cause i'm worthy, unworthy of you<br>Just give me the crumbs<br><br>
