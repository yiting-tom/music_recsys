<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
2010 release from the cult British band led by singer, songwriter and mainman Dan Treacy. TVPs have always meant something more in other countries than their native UK. The music has been remixed by many; Swedish New Yorker enigma Mabel recorded a fantastic version of 'All The Young Children On Crack'. MGMT are collaborating with Dan soon and they have a song on their new album 'Song for Dan Treacy'. Dan has been asked over and over to write songs for other bands and is working on tracks for The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart, The Crystal Stilts and more. TVPs rocked many festivals including Benicassim and All Tomorrows Parties (invited by MBV) , where The Horrors, Sonic Boom, Kramer, J. Mascis and more all waited in TVPs backstage dressing room before and after the show to pay their respects. Needless to say, they are legends. Rocket Girl.
