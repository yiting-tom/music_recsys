<br>
<br>
   Stick To Your Guns is a five-piece melodic Straight Edge hardcore band from Orange County, CA. The group began in the summer of 2003 when vocalist Jesse Barnett was inspired to form a band that would provide him with a medium to express his points of view and reflect his musical influences. STYG blends melody, heaviness, and sincerity into one solid sound that will cater to fans of Comeback Kid, Throwdown, Ignite, and Rise Against.<br><br>damn Ash Avildsen of Sumerian Records first noticed the band, he put them on as the opener for Ignite's Anaheim House of Blues show that drew over 850 people. After the incredible response and passionate performance, he immediately signed the band on as their agent and the hype began to spread all of the country. STYG then completed a Westcoast tour with Caliban and The Acacia Strain in October, as well as a 7 week co-headline tour in November and December with Too Pure to Die and As Blood Runs Black. STYG headlined all of the Texas and California shows with all of the turnouts being between 300 and 500 kids. STYG also holds the record for the highest attendance ever at the Chain Reaction in Anaheim, Orange County's premier all ages venue. Even before signing to Sumerian Records, the amount of momentum behind the band was so powerful that they were chosen to open the Terror tour in January and February 2007 that also featured, The Warriors and All Shall Perish.<br><br>Stick To Your Guns caught the attention of almost every independent label in the music community. Rather than jump into a deal, the band continued their relentless touring schedule and headlined a 6 week US tour that firmly planted their stake in the US touring business by drawing on average 400 people a night. The tour ended in San Diego at an New Years Eve show where over 1,200 people were in attendance.<br><br>STYG's diehard touring work ethic combined with their passionate and infectious live show undoubtedly brought the band success and many exciting opportunities in 2008 including a massive US tour with good friends As Blood Runs Black as well as a large portion of the 2008 Warped Tour. They have even caused fans to strip naked on stage just from the sound of their music. A premier example of this was witnessed in Wichita, Kansas. <br>
