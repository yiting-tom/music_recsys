Some packages seem just too good to be true. Rhian Benson was an articulate and well educated woman (MBA) before she embarked on her musical career. So, she is able to control her musical destiny far more seriously than most artists. She is drop-dead gorgeous and her voice has a sultry quality. It's unfortunate to often hear her compared as just another Nora Jones;, when Rhian Benson's depth and intensity frankly put Jones down a notch. Benson wrote all of the songs on this debut CD which is amazing as many new artists don't dare (I was shocked to note that Nora Jones scarcely writes any of her own material, as lovely as her voice is). Ladies, listen well to Benson's lyrics on her track 'Invincible'. Well worth the buy! --tirefire123<br><br>I first heard this CD while listening to WCLK online out of Atlanta, Tavis Smiley intervied her and played samples of most of the songs. Not only did she appear very humble to be soo beautiful as I now see, but she was intelligent, heartfelt and compassionate. She discussed her life in her hometown of Ghana and her migration to Los Angeles, both being Gold Coasts. Her music is authentic and her Song Sing to A Child almost brought tears to my eyes, she said that the children in Ghana inspired it. She's true to herself and her music and lyrics are reflections of that. I also like Say How I Feel and Spirit. Her voice is different and her music is really nice. This is a star rising...one to buy! --musical_empress<br><br>I love this album. I have had the pleasure of seeing Rhian perform twice in LA and I was very impressed each time. To describe what this album does to me would be too difficult, but suffice it to say it REALLY moves me. Rhian's lush vocals adorn beautifully arranged tracks that transport you to a land where the bittersweet becomes the beautiful. My faves are Sing to the Child, Young Girl, I'm in a Bind and Invincible. The music is richly organic and I kick back to it when I'm stressed out. Thank you Rhian for bringing your wonderful spirit into my life, I need it. --A Customer <br><br>1. Words Hurt Too<br>2. Say How I Feel<br>3. Stealing My Peace Of Mind<br>4. Soul Boy<br>5.
