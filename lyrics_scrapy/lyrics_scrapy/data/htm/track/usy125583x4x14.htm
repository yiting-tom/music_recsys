<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> Vision Of The Lady Of The Lake</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>The boatman rose to the sound of his heartbeat<br>Loud in the silent approach of the dawn<br>He glanced through the window at mist on the lake<br>Which hung like a shroud in the still of the morn<br>The silver cobwebs spun with the dew<br>Hung from the bushes in filigree splendour<br>And water lilies asleep on the lake<br>Were reflected so delicate, tranquil and tender.<br><br>The boat man sighed as he strode through the woods<br>To the place where his boat lay moored to a stake<br>The hollow sound as his footsteps echoed<br>Until the sound was lost on the lake<br>He cast off, poling the boat from the shore<br>Peering a head through damp clinging haze<br>He thought that he saw strange swirling shapes<br>A trick on the eyes that the mist often plays.<br><br>So intent was the boatman on crossing the lake<br>That he failed to notice the current that flowed<br>Leading his boat from familiar parts<br>He was firmly, yet somehow unknowingly, towed<br>All at once the mist seemed to lift<br>Sufficient to show the boatman a pool<br>That he'd never seen in the whole of his life<br>Unnaturally deep, black and silent, and cool.<br><br>The boatman's shirt clung to his back<br>He was sweating both from exertion and fear<br>He had the sensation that someone was watching<br>He felt the presence of somebody near<br>An invisible force prevented him moving<br>The strength of his arms was utterly sapped<br>The twisted bushes converged round the lake<br>Like a fish in a net he was trapped.<br><br>Suddenly out of the water before him<br>The wraith-like form of a maiden appeared<br>Clad in shimmering radiant robes<br>The maiden materialised as she neared<br>The hair which finely crowned her head<br>Was a halo of golden reflecting the sun<br>All of the beautiful women of time<br>Were formed all at once into one.<br><br>She handed the boatman the sword she was holding<br>Which flashed irridescent before his eyes<br>Excalibur surely was hardly a match<br>For a sword that simple description defies<br>The boatman stood transfixed by her gaze<br>Which reached to the depths of his very soul<br>To he who could conquer the evils of life<br>She offered herself as a whole.<br><br>The maiden vanished before his gaze<br>Leaving him clutching the sword in his fist<br>The hairs on the nape of his neck seemed to stiffen<br>A creature approached him from out of the mist<br>It was powerful, huge and yet stupid indeed<br>For it held right back and failed to attack<br>The boatman struck at its small stupid eyes<br>And it crashed to the ground and lay on its back.<br><br>Without a warning the sky seemed to blacken<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>As though the sun were in total eclipse<br>The boatman crouched low as a vast eagle swooped<br>And a horrified cry escaped from his lips<br>It strutted before him with pride in its bearing<br>Admiring its talons both vicious and cruel<br>Taking advantage the boatman struck fast<br>And the eagle slid to the depths of the pool.<br><br>The terrified boatman tried moving his boat<br>But his pole had grown roots in the watery deep<br>The bank grew alive with the coils of a snake<br>And all you could hear was its slither and creep<br>It cast an envious stare at the boatman<br>Slid into the water and swam to the boat<br>He stood hypnotised by its green jealous eyes<br>As it came from the water and coiled round his throat.<br><br>As its coils tightened slowly his breath came in gasps<br>As he choked so he lifted the sword in despair<br>As the snake was still gloating he severed its head<br>And in death the snake's coils thrashed wild in the air<br>The boatman wiped the sweat from his brow<br>His heart was pounding as never before<br>His eyes like a lizard's tongue darted around<br>Not daring to rest for a minute or more.<br><br>An involuntary shiver went up his spine<br>As he heard the sound of eerie howls<br>A wolf appeared on the banks of the pool<br>Saliva dripped from its loathsome jowls<br>Hatred smouldered deep in his eyes<br>Which glowed like coals from Hades fire<br>It seemed to grow as it crouched and snarled<br>And watched as the boatman began to tire.<br><br>It was almost as though the wolf had learned<br>For it did not attack as the others had done<br>But bided its time until the moment was right<br>And sprang as the boatman stared into the sun<br>But the boatman too had learned to hold back<br>And holding his sword as though a knife<br>He plunged it deep into the wolf's heart<br>Then fell to his knees and prayed for his life.<br><br>As he felt a hand on his shoulder he whirled<br>To find the maiden by his side<br>She smiled and the world seemed to open before him<br>He tried to speak but his tongue was tied<br>You must plunge the sword deep into my heart<br>Lest I should crumble into dust<br>She offered the boatman the meaning of life<br>And love, if he could but conquer lust.<br><br>She bared her breasts before his eyes<br>The boatman still was stricken dumb<br>He flung the sword back into the water<br>Back to the depths from which it had come<br>The water around him began to boil<br>The maiden began to wither away<br>His boat was swamped as the creatures arose<br>And evil lived for another day.<br><br>
