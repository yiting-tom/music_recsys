His upcoming album 'Greater Than' is set to be a fan favorite and placing Tribbett's newest release where he is known to be, next level.<br><br>ABOUT TYE TRIBBETT<br>Tye Tribbett first came to national attention in 1997 when he entered his group, GA, into the McDonalds and Wrigley's Gospel choir competitions, where they 'swept the competitions,' winning first place in all categories. The group quickly became highly in demand, performing with music industry superstars Gloria Estefan, LeAnn Rimes, Elton John, Luther Vandross, and Stevie Wonder. They also appeared with Jill Scott, India Arie, John Mellencamp, Musiq Soulchild, and The Roots, among many other artists, and toured with Faith Hill and Don Henley. Tribbett and his group performed 'Let Go, Let God' on the soundtrack of the Dream Works animated film 'The Prince of Egypt' with award-winning duo Mary Mary. The group also appeared on Commons' Electric Circus album, Jessica Simpsons' Christmas album, Will Smiths' project 'Lost &amp; Found', on a song featuring Mary J. Blige, and Justin Timberlake's 'Cry Me A River.'<br><br>His highly anticipated debut album, 'Life' (2004), brought Tribbett and his group, GA (Greater Anointing), a wide array of new fans and a Stellar Award nomination. Tribbett's sophomore project with GA, 'Victory', was released in 2006, debuting at #1 on Billboard's Top Gospel Albums chart. This break-out project, which included the #1 gospel radio single, 'Victory,' received three Stellar Awards, three GRAMMY® Award nominations and a Dove Award nomination. His third release, 'Stand Out' (2008), again topped the charts and earned the group another nomination for a GRAMMY® Award. In 2009, Tribbett, who is also an accomplished musician who plays multiple instruments, retired GA and made other changes in his musical style and direction, resulting in the 2010 release of the aptly named 'Fresh'.
