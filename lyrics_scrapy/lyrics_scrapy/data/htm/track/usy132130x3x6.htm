<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> I Remember</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>[Intro：]<br>Seems like everything is a little different now*<br>M-Phazes, you know what I mean man<br>It's funny how people treat you<br>when they see your name on a CD or somethin<br>I didn't forget y'all<br>The ones who fronted on a nigga when I was tring to get some shine<br>But now the tables turn<br>'And it's showtime.'<br>Hell yeah<br><br>[Chorus: (2x):]<br>I remember rockin' shows for free, tryin' to sell a CD<br>Hand in hand I can't go there again<br>I can't forget<br>Dealin' with the B.S., yes the bullshit<br>When nobody was givin' a damn<br><br>[Verse One]<br>I feel like I'm in another world another place<br>Within the span of two years, the way they see a brother's face<br>Has taken a drastic change<br>360<br>Ladies and cats don't act the same<br>I guess that explains why my phone keeps continuously ringin', people reachin' out<br>Before they were deep in doubt<br>They didn't think I'd even amount<br>To be more than a battle MC with punchlines<br>Or rapped over mediocre beats but now it comes time<br>For me to explode, shine and get some love<br>Like Michael J. Fox, nobody knew how sick I was<br>But at the end of the day<br>It ain't even about the way I spit<br>It's about the bigger names that I'm associated with<br>The rap game is nothing more than bullshit and politics<br>With shady cats tryin' to squeeze ever dollar out of it<br>Now everybody's askin' for favors out of the blue<br>But I don't break my neck for anyone outside of my crew<br>I used to walk around the club every week feelin' foolish<br>Gettin' zero amount of love, tryin' to hustle my music<br>And local heads looked at me like I was kidnappin' they shine<br>Actin' like it's cool, but I know what's in the back of their minds<br>Cause half of the time, little motherfuckers wouldn't speak<br>Now they askin' me to rhyme, tryin' to slide me beats<br>Now everything changed<br>Now everyone's a little more friendlier<br>With hidden agendas, you don't think I remember?<br><br>[Chorus][x2]<br>I remember rockin' shows for free, tryin' to sell a CD<br>Hand in hand I can't go there again<br>I can't forget<br>Dealin' with the B.S., yes the bullshit<br>When nobody was givin' a damn<br><br>[x2]<br>I remember (I remember)<br>Hell yeah (Hell yeah)<br>I remember (I remember)<br>Don't you? (Don't you?)<br><br>M-Phazes. What, what? Illmind. D-minor.<br>And Muneshine. Wax Reform y'all<br><br>[Verse Two]<br>I'm from a place where local MCs never get applause<br>Unless they make music for crunk clubs and titty bars<br>So many people think this music biz isn't hard<br>So every other dummy got a label or a business card<br>You gotta watch these fake Barry Gordy sellin' dreams<br>Cause you could sign your life away, they'll walk away with everything<br>These clowns need to watch the bullshit they promise people<br>Like A&amp;R's with less power than the Amish people<br>'I can make you a star!'<br>Yeah, right I don't believe you<br>'Your album is coming out in March!'<br>Man, I'll believe it when I see it<br>Leave it to some companies I'll never see the light of day<br>But Supa is a business man, regardless, I'll find a way<br>And some of y'all are good cats<br>But my landlord and baby mom don't wanna hear about my album gettin' pushed back<br>I look back<br>Learn from my mistakes and keep makin' moves<br>April Fools to anybody thinkin' I'ma wait for you<br>I've put too much time in it to waste it on people<br>And have niggas holdin' me up like K-Swiss sneakers<br>I'm faced with deceivers every day on the regular<br>The norm<br>But I refuse to settle or conform<br>I came way too far to let these 15 seconds of fame slip away<br>It's the same shit a different day<br>And I ain't gon' change son<br>What you think, my memory's shot and I forgot where I came from?<br>Man<br><br>[Chorus][x2]<br>I remember rockin' shows for free, tryin' to sell a CD<br>Hand in hand I can't go there again<br>I can't forget<br>Dealin' with the B.S., yes the bullshit<br>When nobody was givin' a damn<br><br>[Outro]<br>What? What? It's like that y'all, uh<br>Now, class is over. Dismissed<br><br>
