<dd class="hb0">James Travis Tritt (born February 9, 1963) is an American country music singer, songwriter, and actor. He signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1989, releasing seven studio albums and a greatest hits package for the label between then and 1999. In the 2000s, he released two albums on Columbia Records and one for the now defunct Category 5 Records. Seven of his albums (counting the Greatest Hits) are certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); the highest-certified is 1991's It's All About to Change, which is certified triple-platinum. Tritt has also charted more than 40 times on the Hot Country Songs charts, including five number ones — 'Help Me Hold On,' 'Anymore,' 'Can I Trust You with My Heart,' 'Foolish Pride', and 'Best of Intentions' — and 15 additional top ten singles. Tritt's musical style is defined by mainstream country and Southern rock influences.<br><br>He has received two Grammy Awards, both for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals: in 1992 for 'The Whiskey Ain't Workin',' a duet with Marty Stuart, and again in 1998 for 'Same Old Train', a collaboration with Stuart and nine other artists. In addition, he has received four awards from the Country Music Association, and has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1992.</dd>
