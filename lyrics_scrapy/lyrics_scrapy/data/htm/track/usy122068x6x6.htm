Lawrence<br>So how the hell could I believe in Beau Gest?<br><br>You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?<br>You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?<br>You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?<br>Ah, but they hate you, make no mistake, they hate you<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br><br>So I spent a night in Kigali<br>In a five diamond hotel<br>Where maybe someday they'll to the watusi<br>On down in Hutu hell<br><br>I fell in with a merchant marine<br>Who promised to take me home<br>But when I woke up all beaten and bloodied<br>I couldn't tell if it was Jersey or Sierra Leone<br><br>You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?<br>You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?<br>You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?<br>Ah, but they hate you, they hate you 'cause you're guilty<br><br>So, you didn't think they could hate you, now did you?<br>You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?<br>You didn't think they could hate you, now would you?<br>Ah, but they hate you, make no mistake, they hate you<br><br>And the knocking in my head<br>Just like the knocking at my door<br>And maybe it was me or maybe it was my brother<br>But either me or me and him went down to the bar<br><br>Where I got seven powers in me<br>For to give me the cure<br>When seven powers failed to spin me<br>I had to get me seven more<br><br>And when I say me<br>I mean my brain<br>And when I say give me the cure<br>I mean to kill the pain<br><br>And when I say kill the pain<br>I mean to get the devil out<br>And when I say devil<br>I mean the manifestation of doubt<br><br>You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?<br>You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?<br>You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?<br>Ah, but they hate you, they hate you 'cause you're guilty<br><br>So, you didn't think they could hate you, now did you?<br>You didn't think they could hate you, now did you?<br>You didn't think they could hate you, now would you?<br>Ah, but they hate you, make no mistake, they hate you<br><br>
