<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
Tommy Castro's first release for the Alligator label might just be the best yet from this veteran Bay Area blues artist. Castro has long been known for his mixture of blues, soul and rock. His world-wide touring earned him a 2008 Blues Music Award as Entertainer of the Year. But HARD BELIEVER showcases Castro's soulful voice, searing guitar and excellent song writing ability as it reaches new heights. Castro pays homage on this CD to the Memphis sound while not being afraid to update it for a new century.<br><br><br>Listen to the title cut, close your eyes and you will be convinced that you are listening to Otis Redding singing in 1967. 'Hard Believer' is one of the greatest songs Castro has ever written, which is saying something. Castro's plaintiff, soul dripping vocals display not only the influence of Otis but other blues/soul legends like Ray Charles, Delbert McClinton and Wilson Pickett. Castro even does an excellent job of covering one of the Wicket Pickett's songs on this album: 'Ninety-Nine and One Half.'<br><br><br>Soul music was not just great emotional singing, however. Where would Stax Records be without the horn section? And HARD BELIEVER is filled with tremendous horn work from Keith Crossan and Tom Poole. And just as with the legends of soul, Castro knows how to use the horns as perfect counterpoint to the vocals, not so much as a 'call and response' of classic gospel/blues, but as a way of underlining the feeling of the song. The horns fill the spaces within the songs and grab at your heart.<br><br><br>Another classic element of soul music was that at a time of political turmoil when American cities burned each long hot summer, the Memphis sound was a sound of hope. On 'Hard Believer' Castro sings, ''Lost my faith in miracles, but here I go believing again.'' This is songwriting that fits today's world.<br><br><br>But Castro is not just a great soul singer, he is also a great guitarist. And on songs like the up-tempo 'Definition of Insanity' and the rock/shuffle 'It is What It Is', Castro gets a chance to display his guitar. Another standout track here is 'Trimmin' Fat.' Castro shows an ability to update soul with his blistering slide which comes right out of the blues/rock idiom. His writing addresses the systematic destruction of American jobs that had taken place in recent years. This is not a nostalgia trip album. Castro sings, ''They do your job in China for 100 bucks a day. You better come down and get your last week's pay. Now I did not lose my job. I know where it's at. Everybody's trimmin' fat.'' This is timely topical blues for the first decade of the 21st century. The song fades out with Castro asking, ''What about my 401 K? How bout that boss man? We could give him a little less money and that would make a nice big job for me.'' Tell that to the banksters and crooks at Citibank and Goldman Sachs. Castro probably won't be invited to play that protest song at any well paying corporate gigs.<br><br><br>Castro wrote six of the 12 tracks on HARD BELIEVER. Besides the Pickett cover, he also includes covers of Dylan's 'Gotta Serve Somebody' as well as a brilliant fast-paced Alan Toussaint song, 'Victims of the Darkness' and 'My Babe' by the Righteous Brothers. The production here is excellent and the sound is lush. The album was produced by John Porter, who has worked with artists including Elvis Costello, Roxy Music, B.B. King and Keb Mo.<br><br><br>After 20 years as a solo artist and 13 albums, Tommy Castro is just hitting his stride. He is one of the greatest blues guitarists, songwriters and entertainers in the world today. HARD BELIEVER shows us why and gives a hint of the great work he is about to produce with Alligator. --Blurt (8/17/09)
