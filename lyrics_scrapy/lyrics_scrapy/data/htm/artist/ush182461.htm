<dd class="hb0">Daniel Skye (born June 19, 2000) is an American singer and songwriter, raised in Hollywood, Florida and now based in Los Angeles. His popularity on video and streaming services and achievements on the iTunes charts since the release of his first single in December 2014 led to his signing with RCA Records in September 2016.<br><br>He began his route to popularity in an unusual way, by posting 15-second snippets of covers of popular songs on Instagram, where he has netted 2.5 million followers, rather than initially focusing on YouTube or other sites more commonly identified with music. He released his first original song, 'Maybe,' in December 2014. The video has been viewed over 4.6 million times on YouTube as of this writing.[citation needed]<br><br>His next original single was 'LoveSick Day,' followed in May 2015 by 'All I Want' feat. Cameron Dallas, which debuted on iHeartRADIO and charted on iTunes in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Spain, Australia and Brazil, reaching #34 on its U.S. chart debut on May 4. The 'All I Want' video was viewed more than 22 million times on YouTube, while the song received over 14 million streams on Spotify.<br><br>In 2015 he toured extensively, including on the DigiFest Tour with Demi Lovato, Magcon, Sunsation, Aaron Carpenter and others. He was also selected to perform as part of a Macy's back-to-school campaign that year.<br><br>The single 'We Got Us,' with over 5.9 million Spotify plays as of this writing, made him a Nickelodeon #BuzzTracks artist in March 2016. The video for his July 2016 single 'Smile' amassed over 5.8 million views within six months on YouTube, and Tiger Beat nominated the song in the 'Most Influential Song' category in the magazine's '19 Under 19' feature in September.<br><br>His September 2016 follow-up, 'Good as it Gets,' produced by Charlie Handsome (Kanye West, Ariana Grande, Mac Miller) and released in conjunction with his signing with RCA, netted over three million Spotify plays and three million YouTube views.<br><br>His first official single for RCA, 'ON,' was released in January 2017, and he is going on tour with Bebe Rexha beginning in March 2017.</dd>
