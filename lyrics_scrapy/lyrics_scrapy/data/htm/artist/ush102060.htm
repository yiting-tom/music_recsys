<dd class="hb0">Barry White (born Barry Eugene Carter; September 12, 1944 – July 4, 2003), was an American singer, songwriter and composer.<br><br>A three-time Grammy Award–winner known for his distinctive bass-baritone voice and romantic image, White's greatest success came in the 1970s as a solo singer and with The Love Unlimited Orchestra, crafting many enduring soul, funk, and disco songs such as his two biggest hits, 'You're the First, the Last, My Everything' and 'Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe'.<br><br>During the course of his career in the music business, White achieved 106 gold albums worldwide, 41 of which also attained platinum status. White had 20 gold and 10 platinum singles, with worldwide record sales in excess of 100 million, White is one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. His influences included the Rev. James Cleveland, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, and Elvis Presley plus Motown artists The Supremes, the Four Tops, and Marvin Gaye.<br><br>Early life<br><br>White was born Barry Eugene Carter in Galveston, Texas on September 12, 1944, and grew up in South Central Los Angeles. White was the older of two children. His brother Darryl was 13 months younger than Barry. He grew up listening to his mother's classical music collection and first took to the piano, emulating what he heard on the records.<br><br>White has often been credited with playing piano, at age 11, on Jesse Belvin's 1956 hit single, 'Goodnight My Love.' However, in a 1995 interview with Larry Katz of the Boston Herald, White denied writing or arranging the song. He believed the story was an exaggeration by journalists. While White and Belvin lived in the same neighborhood, Belvin was 12 years older than White. White also stated that he had no involvement with Bob &amp; Earl's 1963 hit single 'Harlem Shuffle', a song he is credited with producing  and in his 1999 autobiography, White confirmed the song had been produced by Gene Page, who had worked with him on many of White's 1970s successes.<br><br>White's voice deepened suddenly when he was 14. White recalled: '[As a child], I had a normal squeaky kid voice. Then as a teenager, that completely changed. My mother cried because she knew her baby boy had become a man.'<br>Gang life and jail sentence<br><br>His brother Darryl was murdered in a clash with a rival gang, and White himself was jailed—at the age of 16—for stealing $30,000 worth of Cadillac tires.<br><br>While in jail, White listened to Elvis Presley singing 'It's Now or Never' on the radio, an experience he later credited with changing the course of his life.</dd>
