of tall black windowsills<br>And my heart jumped every ledge<br>Until one bright morning when I woke<br>I heard bells, girl she gently spoke and said<br>'Choice my man's to breath or choke<br>So go die, or learn to hope'<br><br>Get back on your way at the end of the day<br>Under the fire and the rain<br>The whole big bloody parade until that<br>That feeling, feeling's gone<br>You wake up on your own<br><br>Sometimes walls come caving in<br>Sometimes the world just hits your chin<br>And sometimes shadows haunt your back<br>And sometimes I feel so flat<br>Then like some rare eagle on the wind<br>Well it turns and life comes bursting in<br>And the earth you thought would beat you down<br>Lifts up and lights your ground<br><br>Get back on your way at the end of the day<br>Under the fire and the rain<br>The whole big bloody parade until that<br>That feeling, feeling's gone<br>You wake up on your own<br><br>/ Lifts up and sends you homeward bound<br>/ Lifts up and then you're found again<br>/ Lifts up and turns your world around<br><br>/still scarred of love lived on the ledge<br>And the Earth you thought would eat you up<br>Well it lifts you high and fills your cup<br>/carries<br>And right then I learnt to hope / the point of hope / I knew the way ahead/ to go<br><br>/ lifts up and clears your hallowed ground<br><br>*So scared that love lived on the edge /<br>Scared of love lived on the ledge / Like love lived on the ledge<br><br>/ As if my love required a ledge<br><br>bring you down<br>Lifts up, your heart just leaves the ground<br>/and how you love your ground / high above the ground<br><br>/ and the earth you thought would end your song 'song'<br>/ lifts up and now . . . the feeling's gone feelings gone<br><br>And you wonder how on Earth
