<dd class="hb0">Shayne Thomas Ward (born 16 October 1984) is an English singer and actor, who rose to fame as the winner of the second series of The X Factor. His debut single, 'That's My Goal', was released in the United Kingdom on 21 December 2005 and reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and was that year's Christmas number one. It sold 313,000 copies on its first day of sales, making it the third fastest-selling single of all time in the UK, behind Elton John's 'Candle in the Wind 1997' and Will Young's 'Evergreen', which sold 685,000 and 400,000 copies in their first days of sale respectively.<br><br>Ward was the first X Factor winner to release an original song as his winner's single. His prize, as winner, was a recording contract with Simon Cowell's Syco record label, which is co-owned by Sony Music. His eponymous debut album was released in April 2006. It debuted at number one on both the Irish and UK Albums Charts, going 4× Platinum in Ireland and Platinum in the UK. It spawned two hit singles: 'No Promises' and 'Stand by Me'. The follow-up album, Breathless, featuring the top 10 hits 'If That's OK with You' and 'No U Hang Up', was released in November 2007 and topped the Irish charts, where it went 5× Platinum.<br><br>In November 2010, after a three-year hiatus, Ward released his third album, Obsession. In contrast to Shayne Ward and Breathless, it underperformed with first-week sales of under 23,000, and missed the top 10 in both the UK and Ireland. In 2011, Ward was dropped by Syco. In 2015, he released a new album Closer as an independent artist, funded through PledgeMusic.</dd>
