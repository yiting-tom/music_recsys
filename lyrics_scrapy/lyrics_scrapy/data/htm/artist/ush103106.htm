<dd class="hb0">Reba Nell McEntire (born March 28, 1955) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and record producer. She began her career in the music industry as a high school student singing in the Kiowa High School band, on local radio shows with her siblings, and at rodeos. While a sophomore in college, she performed the National Anthem at the National Rodeo in Oklahoma City and caught the attention of country artist Red Steagall who brought her to Nashville, Tennessee. She signed a contract with Mercury Records a year later in 1975. She released her first solo album in 1977 and released five additional studio albums under the label until 1983.<br><br>Signing with MCA Nashville Records, McEntire took creative control over her second MCA album, My Kind of Country (1984), which had a more traditional country sound and produced two number one singles: 'How Blue' and 'Somebody Should Leave'. The album brought her breakthrough success, bringing her a series of successful albums and number one singles in the 1980s and 1990s. McEntire has since released 29 studio albums, acquired 40 number one singles, 16 number one albums, and 28 albums have been certified gold, platinum or multi-platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America. She has sometimes been referred to as 'The Queen of Country'. and she is one of the best-selling artists of all time, having sold more than 85 million records worldwide.<br><br>In the early 1990s, McEntire branched into film starting with 1990's Tremors. She has since starred in the Broadway revival of Annie Get Your Gun and in her television sitcom, Reba (2001–07) for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series–Musical or Comedy.<br><br>Discography<br>Main articles: Reba McEntire albums discography and Reba McEntire singles discography<br><br>    Reba McEntire (1977)<br>    Out of a Dream (1979)<br>    Feel the Fire (1980)<br>    Heart to Heart (1981)<br>    Unlimited (1982)<br>    Behind the Scene (1983)<br>    Just a Little Love (1984)<br>    My Kind of Country (1984)<br>    Have I Got a Deal for You (1985)<br>    What Am I Gonna Do About You (1986)<br>    Whoever's in New England (1986)<br>    Merry Christmas to You (1987)<br>    The Last One to Know (1987)<br>    Reba (1988)<br>    Reba Live (1989)<br>    Sweet Sixteen (1989)<br>    Rumor Has It (1990)<br>    For My Broken Heart (1991)<br>    It's Your Call (1992)<br>    Read My Mind (1994)<br>    Starting Over (1995)<br>    What If It's You (1996)<br>    If You See Him (1998)<br>    So Good Together (1999)<br>    The Secret of Giving: A Christmas Collection (1999)<br>    Room to Breathe (2003)<br>    Reba: Duets (2007)<br>    Keep On Loving You (2009)<br>    All the Women I Am (2010)<br>    Love Somebody (2015)<br>    My Kind of Christmas (2016)<br>    Sing It Now: Songs of Faith &amp; Hope (2017)</dd>
