<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> Whaling Tale</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>Lyricist：Brendan Canning,  Robert Kraft,  Anthony Seck,  John Capt. Seck<br><br>The story is about a rock penguin<br>It's a small penguin, not a king penguin<br>You can see thousands of them breeding<br>When the warm season starts<br><br>And they only lay one egg at a time<br>And if you take one away they'll lay another egg but no more<br>But I want to tell this story really about<br>One incident, one day it was a gray misty day<br><br>With the wind blowing hard and there was a heavy smell running<br>And a whale factory was pitching and yawing<br>Not really a very good day to pick up the whales<br>Over the stern of the factory ship<br><br>There were one or two dead whales at the stern of the vessel<br>And the whale catchers were coming in with their whales<br>And in the distance you could see the icebergs<br>Quite a number of them<br><br>And the men were trying to get ready<br>To pull the whales over the stern of the vessel<br>There was a pack of killer whales around<br>Which came tearing towards the factory ship<br>And they tore chunks out of the whales<br><br>And there were a number of men at the stern of the vessel<br>With guns shooting at the killer whales<br>The minute they hit a killer whale the rest of the pack went after him<br>And tore him to pieces<br><br>But let's get back to the story of the penguin<br>I'd say there were about 6 or 7 whales<br>Some of them blue, some of them fin at the stern of the vessel<br>And there was that small rock penguin sitting on top of the whale back<br><br>And as we were pulling up the whales one after another<br>Over the stern of the vessel<br>It was rather difficult with the heavy swell running<br><br>The penguin hopped from one whale to another<br>The killer whales were all around the dead whales<br>They were tearing into them and the sea was red with blood<br><br>And by that time there was a number of men<br>From the whale factory coming astern and watching<br>The penguin at the back of the whale<br><br>And the men where shooting as fast as they could<br>To stop the killer whale from getting, getting the penguin<br>Which was sitting or trying to hold on to the back of the whale<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>But as the whale was pulled up they'd shoot<br><br>It was difficult for the winchman to regulate<br>And he had to watch very carefully not to, with the swell of the vessel<br>With the swell of the sea running and the vessel moving<br>To stop the penguin from slipping off its back<br><br>The chute was quite steep, it was about I would say, 30 degrees<br>And the little penguin climbed close to the tail of the whale<br>From which the whale was pulled up the chute<br>And the men were all standing around and watching<br>And hoping that that penguin would finally get up, get up on deck<br><br>It took a long time to lift that last whale up<br>If there was a swell the winchman up on top had to watch<br>And be as careful as possible not to jerk and increase the movement<br>So that the little penguin could stay on top<br><br>We got him to the stern of the chute<br>At the beginning of the chute and he got saved<br>We kept on, we kept on slowly pulling<br><br>And as we pulled the little penguin slowly but surely<br>Went along the back of the whale from the tail<br>Of from the tail to the middle of<br>To the middle of the back<br><br>But at that time the sea was running heavy<br>And the movement at the stern was rather erratic<br>Finally when we got him up about three quarters of the way<br>I don't think there was a man working on the stern of the factory<br><br>They were all watching and hoping too<br>That the little penguin would get up on top<br>As the killer whales were just waiting down below and just watching<br>And the men were shooting and trying to kill these killer whales<br>And therefore they were afraid<br>That the little penguin might slip in the water<br><br>Finally when we got it really all the way up<br>Everybody started to breathe a sigh of relief<br>But there was a heavy, heavy swell which came under the factory<br>And rolled the whale on the side and the little penguin slipped off<br>And as it went down the chute the killer whales got it<br><br>Most of the men were not happy that day<br>There were also there's millions of penguins<br>That was one of the sights which they did not care to see again<br>But that's the way in Antarctic, there's no give and take<br>It's a hard, hard place to be in but, c'est la vie<br><br>
