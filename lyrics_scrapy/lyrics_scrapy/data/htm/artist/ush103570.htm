<dd class="hb0">Tina Turner (born Anna Mae Bullock; November 26, 1939) is an American-born Swiss singer-songwriter, dancer, actress, and author. Turner rose to international prominence as a featured singer with Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm before recording hit singles both with Ike and as a solo performer. One of the world's best-selling artists of all time, she has been referred to as The Queen of Rock 'n' Roll and has sold more than 200 million albums and singles worldwide to date. She is noted for her energetic stage presence, powerful vocals, career longevity,and famous legs. According to Guinness World Records, Turner has sold more concert tickets than any other solo performer in history.<br><br>Turner was born to a small family in Nutbush, Tennessee. Growing up throughout the Southeastern United States, she began singing in local church choirs. She began her career in 1958 as a featured singer with Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm, first recording under the name 'Little Ann'. Her introduction to the public as Tina Turner began in 1960 as a member of the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue. Success followed with a string of notable hits credited to the duo, including 'A Fool in Love', 'River Deep – Mountain High' (1966), 'Proud Mary' (1971), and 'Nutbush City Limits' (1973), a song that she wrote. In her autobiography, I, Tina (1986), she revealed several instances of severe domestic abuse against her by Ike Turner prior to their 1976 split and subsequent 1978 divorce. Raised a Baptist, she encountered faith with Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism in 1971, crediting the spiritual chant of Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, which Turner says helped her to endure during difficult times.<br><br>After her divorce from Ike, she rebuilt her career through live performances. In the 1980s, Turner launched a major comeback with another string of hits, starting in late 1983 with the single 'Let's Stay Together' followed by the 1984 release of her fifth solo album Private Dancer which became a worldwide success. The album contained the song 'What's Love Got to Do with It', which became Turner's biggest hit and won four Grammy Awards including Record of the Year. Her solo success continued throughout the 1980s and 90s with multi-platinum albums including Break Every Rule and Foreign Affair, and with singles such as 'We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)', 'Typical Male', 'The Best', 'I Don't Wanna Fight', and 'GoldenEye', for the 1995 James Bond film of the same name.<br><br>In 1993, What's Love Got to Do with It, a biographical film adapted from her autobiography, was released along with an accompanying soundtrack album. In addition to her musical career, Turner has also garnered success acting in films, including the role of the Acid Queen in the 1975 rock musical Tommy, a starring role alongside Mel Gibson in the 1985 action film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and a cameo role in the 1993 film Last Action Hero. In 2008, Turner returned from semi-retirement to embark on her Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour. Turner's tour became one of the highest selling ticketed shows of 2008–09. Although an American citizen by birth, Turner renounced her American citizenship in 2013 after becoming a citizen of Switzerland.<br><br>Throughout her career, Turner has won 12 Grammy Awards, including eight competitive awards, three Grammy Hall of Fame awards, and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. She is the only female artist to garner concurrent Grammy nominations for pop, rock, and R&amp;B. In 1993, the World Music Awards recognized her years in the music business by awarding her the Legend Award. In 2000, Turner was the female artist with the most shows with 25 at Wembley Arena and with 5 at Wembley Stadium (three in 1996 and two in 2000) by Wembley Arena Record. In the UK, she is the first female artist to have a top 40 hit in six consecutive decades. She has had a total of 34 top 40 hits. Rolling Stone ranked Turner 63rd on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time and 17th on their list of the 100 greatest singers of all time. In 1991, Turner was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Turner has her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the St. Louis Walk of Fame.</dd>
