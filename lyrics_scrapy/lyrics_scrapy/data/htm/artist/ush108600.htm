<dd class="hb0">The Drums are an American indie pop band from New York City.<br><br>Career<br><br>In December 2009 the band was shortlisted as one of the 15 music acts for the BBC Sound of 2010. Subsequently, they placed at No. 5 in this list on 4 January 2010. In NME's first issue of 2010 they were named number 1 in the magazine's top tips for the year as well as in Clash Magazine's Tips for 2010. The Drums were also voted 'Best Hope for 2010' in Pitchfork Media's 2009 Readers' Poll. They won the Hall Radar Award for 2010 and were the most Shazamed band of 2009.<br><br>In February 2010, the band played venues around the UK on the 2010 NME Awards Tour alongside The Maccabees, Bombay Bicycle Club and The Big Pink, going on to play support band for Florence and the Machine's 2010 Cosmic Love tour. In June 2010 they played as one of the support bands for Kings of Leon in Hyde Park, London.<br><br>On May 7, 2010, they appeared on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, where they performed 'Best Friend'. Their debut album was officially released on June 7, 2010, on Moshi Moshi and Island Records. The album contained the singles 'Let's Go Surfing', 'Best Friend,' 'Me and the Moon' and 'Forever and Ever, Amen' as well as 'Down By The Water', which had previously been released as part of the band's Summertime! EP. On September 16, 2010, it was announced on the band's Facebook page and website that guitarist Adam Kessler had left the band.<br><br>The Drums released the single 'The New World' on April 11, 2011, with proceeds going to Japan disaster relief efforts.<br><br>For their second LP, the band recorded quickly, again self-producing, often laying down tracks spontaneously in singer Jonny Pierce’s kitchen. They released Portamento on September 5, 2011. The album title has a deeper meaning for Pierce, as he describes, “Jacob and I meeting as young boys with a shared love for Kraftwerk and Anything Box and Wendy Carlos, and these were all synth pioneers, and a common feature on old analogue systems was ‘Portamento’. The band has also revealed that they almost split at the end of June due to stylistic disagreements. Jacob explained, 'I think our band is kind of fragile and probably on the verge of breaking up pretty constantly and I say that seriously and jokingly at the same time.'<br><br>In 2011, Jonny Pierce co-wrote 'In The Middle (I Met You There)' with Brooklyn artist Matthew Dear for his EP Headcage. His writing credits also include 'You Gave Me Nothing' and 'Lose It (In the End)' which are included in Mark Ronson's album Record Collection.<br><br>After Portamento's world tour ended in late 2012, there were unannounced tensions between the group, Third founding member Connor Hanwick leaving, and exhaustion almost causing a break-up of the group. The Drums remained dormant for the most part during 2013, but had occasional performances throughout most of that year.<br><br>In November 2012, Jonny Pierce announced he would be releasing a solo album in 2013 but The Drums decided to come back after a near breakup. Now The Drums were made up of founding members Jonny Pierce and Jacob Graham.<br><br>The Drums made their American television debut on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon on February 15, 2012. MTV gave the band a celebrity chart special on MTV HD channel in May 2012, where Pierce and Graham introduced their favourite videos and bands as well as some of their own videos.<br><br>On February 16, 2014, The Drums posted, 'celebrating the only way we know how. Album 3 is finished.' on their official Facebook page.<br><br>On July 17, 2014, The Drums announced that their third studio album would be called Encyclopedia and would be released September 23, 2014. In an interview with Billboard Magazine, they stated that he and Graham were ready to come back together and give The Drums another try. They holed up in a lakeside cabin in upstate New York and 'went crazy', says Graham. 'That's when it occurred to me that we can have fun with this and make a record that's interesting and bizarre.' 'The resulting cathartic collection of tracks departs from the Drums' signature 'tonal palette,' as Graham calls it. With taut, spindly guitar lines, liberal sprinklings of tambourine, and uptempo kick drums that belie the brooding, thoughtful content matter of songs like 'Best Friend'.[citation needed]<br><br>On August 20, 2014, they released their new single 'I Can't Pretend'. It was met with much more positive responses compared to previous single 'Magic Mountain'.[citation needed]<br><br>On March 1, 2017, they released the debut single, 'Blood Under My Belt,' from their upcoming album Abysmal Thoughts. It was announced via a Facebook post in which frontman Jonny Pierce took full credit for the writing and producing of the album. Longstanding member Jacob Graham later announced on Instagram that he had left The Drums. In his statement, he said, 'It's actually been over a year now since I left the band but it's just now coming to light with today's press. There are no hard feelings whatsoever, I wish Jonny and the band the best of luck. I'd been with the band for almost ten years and I wanted to focus on my puppetry and my work with my new band Sound of Ceres.' Their fourth album was released on June 16th on ANTI-.</dd>
