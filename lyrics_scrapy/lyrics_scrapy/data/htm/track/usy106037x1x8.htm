The House of Mirrors<br><br>Listen to the tale I tell<br>a haunting dream I know so well<br>When walking home alone one night<br>my path revealed by candlelight<br>Ahead I see an open door<br>with no idea what's in store<br>I glance inside the door to see<br>a hall of mirrors beckon me<br>I take a breath and step inside<br>a tale of love and shattered pride<br>The door slams shut, I start to run<br>And it seems my journey has begun...<br><br>I run and turn from side to side<br>with fear and panic in my eyes<br>The vastness overwhelming me<br>mirrors far as the eye can see<br>I see myself in every one<br>I see the things that I have done<br>A thousand forms of flattery<br>the fear soon turns to haughtiness in me<br><br>Different mirrors, different shapes<br>my different strengths accentuate<br>Each mirror has a name and face<br>and all reflect me in some way<br>I look at them to see myself<br>to judge my life by someone else<br>The metaphors within replete:<br>the mirrors are the people that I meet<br><br>Look at the man you see (in the mirrors)<br>The things you can be (in the mirrors)<br>The glory of me revealed in the mirror's eye<br>The mirror never lies<br>The fire in my eyes (in the mirrors)<br>The vanity rise (in the mirrors)<br>The power of pride comes alive in the mirrors<br><br>Gazing in the mirrors I behold<br>All the greatest chapters of my story ever told<br>In the mirrors<br>The world is turned to gold<br><br>At the end of the Hall of Mirrors<br>I behold a golden door<br>I imagine all the beauty<br>the other side must hold in store<br><br>So I quickly reach out my hand<br>To enter the next room in this promised land<br>I pull the giant door open<br>To continue my journey, I step inside<br>But it slams shut behind me, and I'm back outside<br>The pouring rain welcomes me<br>into the arms of the coldest, blackest night<br><br>II. The Stranger in the Storm<br><br>The light of the mirrors has faded away<br>into distant memory<br>As the rain keeps coming down<br>My candle extinguished<br>I struggle to walk a path I cannot see<br>And the rain keeps coming down<br><br>The darkness grows with every step<br>I could cut it with a knife<br>As the rain keeps coming down<br>I can't see a thing, I've never felt<br>so alone in all my life<br>But the rain keeps coming down...<br><br>Caught in the fury of the storm<br>(The darkness suffocates)<br>Body and soul weary and worn<br>(Another twist of fate)<br>Never been so afraid before<br>(The ending of this tale?)<br>Never should have opened the door<br>(From euphoria to hell)<br><br>I question my fate, my end to die in this storm?<br>Maybe this was the plan back from the day I was born<br>But in the hall of mirrors I had felt so high<br>I cannot walk another mile in this flood<br>So resigned to my fate, I just collapse in the mud<br>If I cannot go on, I'll just lay down and die<br><br>Suddenly a light I see, shining in the distance<br>I make my way toward it with my fading hope reborn<br>As I draw near, the light is clear<br>Though the rain beats its resistance<br>But I press on and pray this is a shelter from the storm<br>Advancing now toward the light (Moving forward)<br>I'm quickly moving forward (Marching forward)<br>This hope has given me new strength (Moving forward)<br>I thought I'd never know (To the light)<br>But I take a step, and fall right back (Moving forward)<br>For the ground is gone beneath me (Marching forward)<br>And I behold, illuminated (Moving forward)<br>in the light's warm glow (To the light)<br>A dark chasm, a great abyss<br>a vast expanse of nothingness<br>a pit that has no bottom as far as the eye can see<br>It spans the whole horizon, and there is no way across<br>My lonely heart is shattered and all hope I had is lost<br><br>I'm startled to feel a hand on my shoulder<br>I turn to see a shadowed figure standing in the rain<br>but somehow I'm not afraid of Him<br>even when He speaks my name<br><br>And somehow I can tell that He means me no harm<br>just by the peace that I see in His eyes<br>And even though I've never even seen Him before<br>it's like He's known me all my life<br>'Why are you crying?' the stranger asks<br>as I wipe away the tears<br>I point toward the great abyss<br>the source of all my fears<br><br>'I must get across and get to that light<br>for it represents my only hope tonight<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>but when I saw the chasm, all that hope was lost<br>I've spent so long in the dark and the rain<br>that the sight of the light made my heart sing again<br>but the gulf's so wide, and there's no way across'<br><br>The stranger smiled, and took my hand<br>He said, 'But you are wrong, my friend<br>You cannot cross the gulf yourself, that's true'<br>He led me down toward the edge<br>and pointed just over the ledge<br>and said, 'Behold, I built a bridge for you'<br><br>I cross the bridge toward the light<br>The stranger saved my life tonight<br>I turn to try to thank Him, but He's gone<br>A long way to the other side<br>I'll make my way without my guide<br>No time to waste, for I must carry on<br><br>The bright light shines forth from behind<br>A door beyond description<br>Blood and scratches mark the door from ages of abuse<br>I'm confused no more, for above the door<br>Is a weathered, old inscription:<br>'All who would see reality, enter the Hall of Truth'<br>And so I do<br><br>III. The Truth Revealed<br><br>As I step inside<br>I can see another mirror<br>A mirror so bright<br>that my eyes must turn away<br>A mirror so high<br>I start to question all the others<br>And as I stand there in the Hall of Truth<br>my heart can only say:<br>'Show me the truth, I don't know what to believe<br>for the mirrors all showed something different to me<br>and my pride has given way to misery<br>I've spent so long in the dark and the rain<br>that the sight of the light made my heart sing again<br>and the stranger built a bridge across for me'<br><br>'BEHOLD THYSELF' a voice rings out<br>in paralyzing thunder<br>It echoes all throughout the hall<br>and sends me to my knees<br>When the voice calls my name<br>I'm overcome with fear and wonder<br>As I slowly start to rise<br>and face the great mirror in front of me<br>When I open my eyes, I have to close them again<br>but still the image is burned in my mind...<br>A face with eyes as black as night<br>A terrifying sight<br>The flesh rotting away in sickness and decay<br>It's mangled by disease<br>I'm unable to breathe<br>Tell me what manner of creature this could be<br>'Cause it's not me<br><br>I run away as fast as my feet will carry me<br>back to the door leading out into the night<br>Even the storm that almost claimed my life<br>was better than this<br>And so I throw open the door and see a man<br>(The figure of a man)<br>The stranger from the storm returns again<br>(To save me once again?)<br>I see understanding in his eyes<br>(He's seen this all before)<br>Maybe He can tell me what I saw behind that door<br><br>'Tell me what I saw in the mirror before I ran away<br>Tell me what I saw in the mirror<br>that face of sickness and decay<br>Tell me what I saw in the mirror that left me terrorized<br>Tell me what I saw in the mirror<br>with the lifeless, blackened eyes?<br>Was it a demon from the fiery waves?<br>Was it the undead from beyond the grave?<br>Oh the face that I beheld in the mirror left me paralyzed<br>Won't you tell me what I saw in the mirror on this night?'<br><br>'The light from the mirror you saw from afar<br>The Mirror of Souls shows all men as they are<br>You entered the hall and you asked for the truth<br>The man that you saw in the mirror was you'<br><br>'No! Don't show me the truth 'cause I don't want to believe<br>What the Mirror of Souls has revealed unto me<br>And the face I saw reflected cannot be me<br>Dying and lost in the arms of decay<br>I do not recognize the face I've seen today<br>And if you say that's my face I must disagree'<br><br>The meaning of these things I saw:<br>The mirror is the holy eyes of God<br><br>The truth unveiled before me<br>with these words of the stranger:<br>'The mirrors you saw in the hall long ago<br>Were mirrors of lies, not reflecting the soul<br>When you look unto others to see what they see<br>You see an illusion, deception, false reality'<br><br>I have seen my soul in the mirror and it has broken me<br>I have seen myself so much clearer than I had ever seen<br>'Can't you take away all this sickness from my soul and set me free?<br>You can save me...I believe'<br><br>And then He said, 'Arise, my child<br>your faith has made you reconciled<br>Now gaze into the Mirror once again'<br>We walked together through the door<br>and I looked in the glass once more<br>but the only one reflected back was Him<br>Somehow the only one the mirror saw was Him<br><br>Gazing in the Mirror of my Soul<br>Staring at the man who took my place and made me whole<br>In the Mirror, the Mirror of my Soul<br><br>
