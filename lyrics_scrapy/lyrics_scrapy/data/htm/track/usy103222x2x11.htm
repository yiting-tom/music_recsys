it's not my fault theres wall to wall empty cans<br>Everyone wanted this to all go wrong for me from the start,<br>It's fucked up that a mans life can just be attacked,<br>Watching this morning with a beer is much better relying on,<br>Unknown cunts for mates i was given that don't have my back.<br>Scott texted me to say he'd have a look at the TV for me,<br>But i layed it down telling him to fuck right off chap.<br>Phoned this company out the yellow pages;<br>Told them to take away the TV and fix it quick snap.<br>The next day they took away the TV and told me they'd repair the little bit,<br>Thats broken round on the back.<br>I thought that would be that but the next bit was on top,<br>This was where it all started to get a bit out of hand.<br><br>No-one gives a crap about Mike;<br>Thats why i'm acting nasty.<br>You know what you can do with your life;<br>Introduce it up your jacksie.<br>'Cause No-one gives a crap about Mike;<br>Thats why i'm acting nasty.<br>You know what you can do with your life;<br>Introduce it up your jacksie.<br><br>The TV man comes back later, knocks on mine,<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>To say he's found something in the back of the TV,<br>I'm looking at it absolutely speechless,<br>Cant quite believe he's trying to pull this fucking stunt on me.<br>I knew it was a simple case of the power supply gone on the back,<br>But he's trying to tap me up for more money.<br>He says it's not like that and I'm like fuck off and die,<br>And stick up my two fingers and one more to make three.<br>He says dont talk to me like that, and i don't understand,<br>Face is in his face and i tell him i understand perfectly.<br>And he grabs my shirt and i grab his face with my hand,<br>So he brings his fist up and twats me a good one on my cheek.<br>Now I'm trying to pull his head down so i can knee it,<br>But he's got my ear; he's twisting it round so much that it's really hurting me.<br>And we both go down on the floor, and he pushes my head back;<br>Onto the corner of the fridge which is total agony.<br>Then he gets up and runs out the kitchen, and out of the door,<br>Shouting stuff to me, slams the door shoutin' at me.<br>So here i am in my house, drinking on my own settee;<br>Everyones a cunt in this life, no-one's there for me.<br><br>No-one gives a crap about Mike;<br>Thats why i'm acting nasty.<br>You know what you can do with your life;<br>Introduce it up your jacksie.<br>'Cause No-one gives a crap about Mike;<br>Thats why i'm acting nasty.<br>You know what you can do with your life;<br>Introduce it up your jacksie.<br><br>[break]<br><br>If I want to sit in and drink super tennants in the day I will,<br>No-ones going to fucking tell me jack,<br>But can you rely on anyone in this world?<br>No you cant; it's all my fault theres wall to wall empty cans.<br>I sat in the kitchen all fucked off,<br>Imagining over and over what they're all doing behind my back.<br>Dodgy things going on, actions i regretted,<br>Stain bottle with a pipe and tin foil on the matt.<br>Scott texted me telling me he'll have a look at the TV for me,<br>And I Felt like just telling him to fuck right off chap.<br>But what he said about wanting to do the right thing by both mates,<br>And then opting to stay out - it seemed to match.<br>But i's told him he could make it up by fixing the TV,<br>He said thats the least he could do to square things flat.<br>I thought that would be that but then the next bit was mad,<br>This is where everything started to all turn back.<br><br>The end of the something i did not want to end,<br>Begining of hard times to come.<br>But something that was not meant to be is done,<br>And this is the start of what was.<br><br>He had to unscrew about fifteen screws before he could pull the panel off the back,<br>To get in the fecking thing;<br>But just as he did so, he said he saw something,<br>That slipped inside behind the panel - down the back of it.<br>Must have been some leaflets or a bill maybe,<br>I didn't want to lose the bill incase it was a final warning.<br>So we both tried to get the back off and work out if there was any more screws to get out,<br>Or if we left any in.<br>And when he looked down the back of the TV, his eyes just froze,<br>Before he rammed his hand in saying, no shit.<br>He's looking at me absolutely speechless,<br>he can't quite believe what he's trying to pull out the slip.<br>I get up wondering what he's smiling about, he's shaking his head at this point,<br>With the biggest of grins;<br>I look down the back of the TV and thats where it was, in all it's glory - my thousand quid.<br><br>The end of the something i did not want to end,<br>Begining of hard times to come.<br>But something that was not meant to be is done,<br>And this is the start of what was.<br><br>About 2 this afternoon the last of the people left my house,<br>'Cause they never stop chattin' til all the rackets gone.<br>I really feel like things clicked into place at some point,<br>Or maybe it's the fact that me and Alison really got on.<br>Or maybe it's that i realised that it is true;<br>No-ones really there fighting for you in the last garison.<br>No-one except yourself that is, no-one except you.<br>You are the one who's got your back 'til the last deeds done.<br>Scott can't have my back til the absolute end,<br>'Cause he's got to look out for what over his horizon.<br>He's gotta to make sure he's not lonely, not broke.<br>It's enough to worry about keeping his own head above.<br>I shut the door behind me, huddled up in my coat,<br>Condensation floating off my breath, squinted out the sun.<br>My jeans feel a bit tight, think i washed them a bit too high;<br>I was gonna be late, so i picked up my pace to run.<br><br>The end of the something i did not want to end,<br>Begining of hard times to come.<br>But something that was not meant to be is done,<br>And this is the start of what was.<br>The end of the something i did not want to end,<br>Begining of hard times to come.<br>But something that was not meant to be is done,<br>And this is the start of what was.<br>The end of the something i did not want to end,<br>Begining of hard times to come.<br>But something that was not meant to be is done,<br>And this is the start of what was.<br>The end of the something i did not want to end,<br>Begining of hard times to come.<br>But something that was not meant to be is done,<br>And this is the start of what was.<br><br>
