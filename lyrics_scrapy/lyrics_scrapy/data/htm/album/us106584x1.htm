<br>
<br>
   The Bird and the Bee is an indie/pop/alternative musical duo from Los Angeles, consisting of musicians Greg Kurstin ('bee') and Inara George ('bird'). Kurstin, a producer and keyboardist who has worked with Lily Allen, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Beck, The Flaming Lips, Kylie Minogue and Red Hot Chili Peppers, is also a member of the band Geggy Tah. Inara George and Kurstin met while the two were working on her debut album and they decided to collaborate on a jazz-influenced electro pop project. Their debut EP, Again and Again and Again and Again, was released on October 2006 and their debut album was released on January 23, 2007 on Blue Note Records.<br><br>According to their MySpace page, 'Greg and Inara met a few years ago. Discovered a common love of jazz standards... nerded out for a couple of hours playing every song they knew... and then wrote and recorded a record together.'<br><br>In December 2006, a remix[1] of their song 'Fucking Boyfriend' topped the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart (because of its title, radio stations only played the edited version of the song in their club mix shows) and in April 2007 the song 'Again &amp; Again' was featured in the episode 'Desire' of Grey's Anatomy. Also their song 'Polite Dance Song' from Please Clap Your Hands was featured in the fifth episode of the fourth season of Grey's Anatomy.<br><br>Their holiday single 'Carol of the Bells' was featured as the Free Single of the Week on iTunes for the week of November 27, 2007.<br><br>The 'Polite Dance' music video was directed by Eric Wareheim (12/07/2007).<br><br>A few days before Valentines' 2008, the group released their digital EP One Too Many Hearts for purchase online. This EP features a rendition of Tonight You Belong to Me.<br><br>The Bird and the Bee have started to pick up steam in 2008 by appearing on several film soundtracks. 'Fucking Boyfriend' appeared in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and their cover of 'How Deep Is Your Love' appeared on the Sex and the City: The Movie soundtrack. They also had a song featured on the third season of the Tim &amp; Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! episode 'Larry'.<br><br>In July 2008 the Bird and The Bee did a live recording of 4 of their tracks, plus 1 new track at The Palms in Las Vegas. The tracks were: Again &amp; Again (Bossa Nova Version), Fucking Boyfriend, Autumn Leaves, Man &amp; Preparedness. This digital EP was sold exclusively on iTunes for 4.49 (USD). <br>
