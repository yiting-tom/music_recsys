<br>
Kingpins of the American folksong revival, the New Lost City Ramblers were both 'rear guard' and avant-garde. They looked backward in time to the geniuses of American folk music tradition, mastering and emulating their sounds, sensibilities, and syntax. No urban folk music performer could claim more of a connection to and admiration for fountainheads of folk artistry such as Dock Boggs, Roscoe Holcomb, Elizabeth Cotten, Frank Proffitt, Eck Robertson, and many others. They constantly credited them in their performances and paid them the highest form of compliment in their emulation. At the same time, their music was far from a pale imitation of others. They were masters of the idiom they revered, leaving their own stamp on their music.<br><br>Mike Seeger, John Cohen, and Tom Paley launched the group in 1958, recording nine albums in their first four years. When in 1962 Yale-trained mathematician Paley moved on, Tracy Schwarz joined to complete the trio, appearing on their next seven albums and over two decades of active performing. The Ramblers appeared at pinnacle performance venues that featured American counter-culture's swelling folk music wave, including Carnegie Hall, the University of Chicago Folk Festival, and the Newport Folk Festival. They were pivotal as much to the folk revival as to the 'folk arrival'--creating spaces in urban concert halls for the rural, source musicians they came to know through their many fieldwork pilgrimages to Appalachia and beyond. This trilogy spans the core of New Lost City Rambler accomplishment and is framed by the deeply knowledgeable and elegant writings of folk music savants Jon Pankake and Ray Allen. As a whole, it captures a clear glimpse of the breadth and depth of the Rambler legacy and its enduring importance to the American story. <br><br>1. Colored Aristocracy<br>2.
