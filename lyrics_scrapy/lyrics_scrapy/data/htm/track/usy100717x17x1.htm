Pretend he never existed<br>Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten<br>And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long<br>That I've stopped the plottin'and still ain't coming to get ya<br>You're wrong and that shit was rotten<br>And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, go!<br>Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?<br>Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to<br>Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing<br>Letters, you don't respond to 'em<br>Fuck it, I'm coming to see you<br>And gee who better to talk to than you?<br>The cause of my problems<br>My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you[Hook<br><br>[Hook:]<br><br>I've been driving around your side of this town<br>Like 9 frickin'hours and 45 minutes now<br>Finally I found your new address, park in your drive<br>Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life<br>And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva<br>My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house<br>See, it's sad it came to this point<br>Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya<br>But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology<br>Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek<br>So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window<br>Like I reach my full potential, I peaked<br>Continue to peep, still bent low<br>Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo<br>Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch<br>Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this<br>You don't plan for intruders before hand?<br>Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?<br>Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack up a lung<br>Like you picked up an axe up and then swung<br>Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk<br>By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?<br>Now who's a faggot, you punk?<br>And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back cause they suck<br>It's just me, you and the music now, Slim<br>I hope you hear it we are in a car right now<br>Wait, here comes my favorite lyric<br>I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die<br>And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP<br>Just to try to get people to buy<br>How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun<br>Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done<br>Eminem killed by M&amp;M<br>Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials<br>I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it<br>Since you love you're city so much<br>I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here<br>Two more exits, town is quite near<br>I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear<br>That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea<br>As cops appear in my driver side mirror<br>(Oh, God, Police!! Ah!)<br>Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least<br>New plan Stan<br>Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car<br>Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you<br>Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh hope you can swim good!<br>Now say you hate homos again!<br><br>I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend<br>I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in<br>I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen<br>Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin<br>No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in<br>When they say all of this is approaching its end<br>But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again<br>Backs to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds<br>Toilets clogged, Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up<br>But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollas<br>After the track is demolished<br>I am your lack of a conscience<br>I'm the ringing in your ears<br>I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils<br>Eating your vocal chords after your concerts<br>I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged<br>Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow<br>I'm the bullies you hate, that you became<br>With every faggot you slaughtered<br>Coming back on you every woman you insult<br>That, with the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters<br>I represent everything, you take for granted<br>'Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade<br>And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic, of you not knowing what you had until it's gone<br>'Cause after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are calling your name<br>Cameras are off<br>Sad, but it happens to all of them<br>I'm the hindsight to say, 'I told you so!'<br>Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow<br>I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow<br>If you don't stop after they call you the<br>Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits<br>When it's time to walk away<br>I'm every guilt trip<br>The baggage you had<br>But as you gather up all your possessions<br>If there's anything you have left to say<br>Unless it makes an impact don't bother<br>So before you rest your case<br>Better make sure you're packing a wallop<br>So one last time, I'm back<br>Before it fades into black and it's all over<br>Behold the final chapter in the saga<br>Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle<br>Twice the magic that started it all<br>Tragic portrait of an artist tortured<br>Trapped in his own drawings<br>Tap into thoughts<br>Blacker and darker than anything imaginable<br>Here goes a wild stab in the dark<br>As we pick up the last Mathers left off<br><br>
