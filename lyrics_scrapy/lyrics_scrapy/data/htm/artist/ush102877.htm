<dd class="hb0">The Honeyz are an English R&amp;B girl group who had five UK Top 10 hits between 1998 and 2000, with 'Finally Found' (1998), 'End of the Line' (1998), 'Love of a Lifetime' (1999), 'Never Let You Down' (2000) and 'Won't Take It Lying Down' (2000). They have sold over four million records worldwide.[citation needed]<br><br>The Honeyz formed in 1997 with the original line-up consisting of Célena Cherry, Heavenli Denton and Naima Belkhiati. Former Solid HarmoniE member Mariama Goodman replaced Denton in 1999. Goodman left in 2000 with Denton rejoining, before the group disbanded for the first time in 2002. The original line-up reformed in 2005 for the ITV show Hit Me, Baby, One More Time. Belkhiati left shortly after and was replaced by Candace Cherry (Celena's sister). Denton then left for a second time and was once again replaced by Goodman. This line-up performed occasional gigs until 2009.<br><br>Célena Cherry, Denton and Goodman re-formed for the 2012 ITV reality show The Big Reunion. This was the first time Denton and Goodman appeared in the same line-up. The show first aired in January 2013 and followed six bands meeting for the first time since they split, and rehearsing for a comeback performance at the Hammersmith Apollo. They went on to perform in the successful 14-date Big Reunion arena tour in May 2013. Denton once again left the group in 2015, with Cherry and Goodman continuing as a duo.</dd>
