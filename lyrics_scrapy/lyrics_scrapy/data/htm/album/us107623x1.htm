<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
   Armistice is the second full-length album by Mute Math, scheduled to be released on August 18th, 2009.<br><br>During the recording of the album, short videos have been posted to the band's YouTube profile. These videos document the work going on in the studio, including street interviews where New Orleans locals are shown samples of the album (which cannot be heard in the video), recording their reactions. Any clips of actual music from the new album are presented in such a way that they only hint at what the album will eventually sound like.<br><br>On April 4, 2008, Goodwin Films announced they were working on a documentary film about the making of Mute Math's new record. No further details have been announced regarding the release of the film. <br><br>On August 2, 2008, in an interview with The Morning Call, Meany spoke about the new record. 'We want to keep it in the oven and make sure things are ready to go,' says Meany. 'Anyone who thinks first album is perfect will hate this [new] record. If you heard the first record and liked some stuff about it [but] think things could improve, you may like it. It's important for us to change up the formula. We thought we were writing [the new album] for the last 2½ years on the road, but found out we weren't. We just started three months ago.'<br><br>On January 14, 2009, King said in an interview that after a break for the holidays, they would 'get back to recording in hopes of having everything done in March so that the album can come out in August. It has taken way longer than we would have ever imagined but we』re just not done with it yet.' Additionally, he mentioned that the album was Mute Math's first album which involved collaboration among all four members of the band.<br><br>The title for the sophomore record was confirmed as Armistice on May 27th, 2009 in an interview on InsideBayArea.com and then confirmed on the same day on the Mute Math forumsTeleprompt Records and Warner Bros. Records made a joint press release on June 9, 2009 announcing the details of the album release including the name Armistice, album cover, and track listing, as well as the official US release date of August 18.<br><br>A special tour package of the Armistice album was released including a ticket to a Mute Math concert with 'first-in-line' access, an invitation to an exclusive listening party held in advance of the album's release, a T-shirt, a lithograph, and a digital download of the Armistice album. The package also includes digital downloads of the single 'The Nerve' as well as B-side recordings 'Valium' and 'Armistice (2nd Line Version)' featuring Rebirth Brass Band. <br>
