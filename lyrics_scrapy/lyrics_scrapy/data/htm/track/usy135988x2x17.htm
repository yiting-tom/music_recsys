ladyfinger mountains topped with whipped cream whiter than snow, sweetly glazed flowers and butter-cream frosting everywhere she looks.<br>Upon their arrival, they are greeted by the Sugar Plum Fairy.<br>As they reenact the night's events, the Sugar Plum Fairy becomes impressed with Clara's bravery and the Nutcracker's heroism.<br>In their honor, the Sugar Plum Fairy takes them inside the Candy Castle and throws a lavish festival.<br>They are treated like royalty and presented with every imaginable sweet.<br>Shortly thereafter, the dancing begins.<br>Hot coco dances to the lively music of trumpets and castanets of the Spanish fandango.<br>The women of coffee dance in veils and move their bodies like rising steam to an Arabian song, while Mandarin tea dances to an exotic Asian flute .<br>Matroishkas (Russian dolls) follow the Mandarin tea leaping and dancing to an invigorating Russian Trepak.<br>To Clara's enjoyment there is still more to be seen.<br>A giant gingerbread house, known as Mother Ginger, dances onto the Sugar Plum Fairy's court.<br>She opens her skirt and eight little gingerbread children come dancing out circling around her.<br>After the Mirliton dance is over, the children quickly file back into the large gingerbread house and Mother Ginger leaves the room.<br>Soon after Mother Ginger exits, the dancing flowers enter to the tune of the harp.<br>Perhaps the most beautiful waltz she has ever heard, Clara and the Nutcracker Prince watch with amazement.<br>The flowers dance in beautiful mesmerizing patterns as a single Dewdrop floats above them.<br>Silence quickly follows the end of their dance.<br>Clara doesn't know what to expect next.<br>A handsome Cavalier enters the scene and escorts the Sugar Plum Fairy to the center of the room.<br>They dance to the most recognizable song in the entire work.<br>The captivating pair dance lighter than air.<br>This beautiful dance completes Clara's most perfect evening.<br>The festival concludes when everyone comes together on the court and bids Clara and the Nutcracker Prince farewell.<br>She tells the Nutcracker she wishes the adventure would never end and he tells her it won't for those who have an eye to see it.<br>Clara wakes up the next morning under the Christmas tree with her Nutcracker still in her arms.<br><br>
