<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> Last Call</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>Ayo real talk, 6ix<br>As soon as you played me this joint, I already knew<br>I was like, 'Yo, this some fucking, 'Last Call' shit'<br>And it got me hella excited 'cause I always wanted to do like<br>A 'Last Call,' I remember the first time I heard Kanye's<br>I thought that shit was so tight, dawg<br>And I was like, man I'm tryna tell my story, you know what I'm sayin'?<br>And then uh, I remember Cole did it, when did he do it?<br>He was on Friday Night—<br>Nah, nah, he did it on The Warm Up yo<br>When he did the 'Last Call' on The Warm Up, I was like 'Damn I'm tryna do mine'<br>So since this joint got that vibe, I'ma do my own 'Last Call' right now for y'all<br>And my voice is messed up too, this is the last track of Young Sinatra<br><br>Yeah, yeah<br>Back in the day I wasn't shit, homie<br>Penny pinching I couldn't even pay the rent, homie<br>Thinkin' 'bout it I'm wondering where the years went, homie<br>Just a youngin' tryna survive, they was hatin' on me<br>I was working that nine-to-five, I was waitin', homie<br>I was bussin' tables fantasizin' 'bout cakin', homie<br>Letting 'em slip away my dreams, wasn't waitin' on me<br>This for anyone with ambition, calling anybody that'll listen<br>I'm wishing all your dreams come true, 'cause mine did<br>And yeah, you know I had to put that in the rhyme kit<br>But that shit came from sacrifice<br>Not on the corner selling drugs and smackin' dice (listen)<br>Yeah<br><br>Someway, somehow, I understood finally<br>If you want to come and get it, you know where to find me<br>'Cause I ain't got no time for anyone that be tryin' me<br>Know if they don't understand, I'ma leave 'em behind me<br>Obviously<br>I ain't got no time, no, no<br>I said obviously<br>I said I don't got no time, no, no, no<br><br>Yeah, yeah<br>I treat the beat like it's my only son, my DNA<br>And this that southern playalistic shit like we was in the A<br>Back in the day, I was Young, Broke &amp; Infamous<br>A Young Sinatra that was Undeniable<br>Who Welcome-d you To Forever while Under Pressure<br>And told you The Incredible True Story of Bobby Tarantino<br>And Everybody in the Ultra 85<br>Goddamn, it feel good to be alive<br>And all these bitches that I passed up<br>Couldn't fuck witcha 'cause your hair was too gassed up<br>'Member creeping with the gat, masked up<br><br>God damn, it's kinda crazy to reminisce on all this shit man<br>What it was like growing up<br>Damn man, just, motherfuckers running in and out of the crib, Doing drugs, selling drugs, all types of stuff<br>Meanwhile, I was just tryna keep it together<br>I was tryna make sense—sense of all this shit around me<br>I didn't know how to take it, how to perceive it, you know what I mean?<br>And then meanwhile I'm supposed to be going to school and getting good grades and shit<br>But I'm seeing like, domestic violence in my house<br>And just, so much going on<br>And I'm sure everybody was probably like, 'Damn, yo'<br><br>'Why little Bobby didn't come to school today?'<br>On the real, I was doin' anything to run away<br>And that's the same reason kids join gangs every day<br>'Cause they wanna be accepted, but at home they too neglected<br>Meanwhile, white America quick to call him a thug<br>But all he ever wanted was a father to give him some love<br>Tell him that he love him, that he need him<br>Promise he won't ever leave him<br>Never smoke crack, never lie, and won't never beat him<br>It feel like for my life I been needed a break<br>Looking at my family, I ain't wanna make the same mistake<br>And I know that shit sound fucked up but they not all doin' great<br>Oh God, please<br>Can I have a conversation with a member of my family without it ending asking me for five G's?<br>To pay they bills or they lawyer fees (huh)<br>I learned something, I ain't giving y'all a dime<br>I'll give you something worth more—that's my time<br>I ain't dropping stacks, I'm dropping knowledge<br>Unless it's for my nieces and nephews to go to college<br>And hit me on the phone, hit me up<br>Like, 'Uncle Bob, where you at?<br>Yeah, I know your pockets fat but I don't give a fuck 'bout that<br>I'm glad we family' (uh)<br>We a half-breed family, yeah, yeah, uh<br><br>Man, see, I remember when I was like fifteen years old<br>And my dad took me to the studio<br>I know this is random, I'm tryna take you guys through it, right?<br>And, I'll never forget it, I had like eight rhyme books<br>He'll tell you—he'll tell you, man<br>I just, I went through them motherfuckers<br>I was rapping for like fifteen minutes straight<br>And that was my first time, yo<br>I was like tenth grade, in the studio<br>And I knew that this was what I wanted to do<br>I knew it<br><br>I knew it ever since I first saw Kill Bill<br>I been flowin' like that blood, Uma Thurman spilled<br>None other than the RZA, yeah he did the soundtrack<br>And then I discovered Wu-Tang soon as I found that<br>And then Big L, Mos Def, and Nas, it wouldn't no turning back<br>I couldn't change it if I tried, homie, how 'bout that?<br>See, I'm a student of the game, so simple and plain<br>But I'ma to take it back to before I ever sat first class on a plane<br><br>I was in College Park, right?<br>Well I guess, technically, if you wanna go before that<br>I was uh, I was living in Germantown<br>Uh, nah, actually it was Montgomery Village<br>Back in Maryland, I was living in my sister's basement<br>And then some shit happened, you know, she kicked me out<br>It was Christmas, whatever, I love you Genie<br>Anyway, so shit happened, and then I just kept it pushing<br>You know, I was homeless for a little while, whatever, you know<br>I went, uh, I stayed at my mentor's house, Solomon<br>Uh, and then I stayed back at my—my godparents' house<br>Mary Jo and Bernie, I love y'all<br>Uh, Mary Jo, I'm sorry, back when I used to smoke<br>I would steal the shit out of your cigarettes<br>I love you, I'm sorry about that, but<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>You remember—always she would let me record<br>I'd always be recording in the attic or wherever I could, so<br>I love you—thank you for supporting me there<br>But then, she was like, 'You gotta get the fuck outta here' too<br>After a while, she gave me some time<br>But like, I was twenty years old at this point<br>She was like, 'Nah, you gotta get the fuck outta here and do something with your life'<br>And this was right around the time that I opened up my first show ever for Ghostface Killah man<br>In Gaithersburg, right in Old Town<br>The shit was insane, I'll never forget it<br>And that's where I met my boy Lenny, Big Lenbo, wassup!?<br>That's right, man, we just started kicking it and hanging<br>He lived in College Park, and before I knew it I was living with him—I was living with him in his basement<br>And this was right around the time I met 6ix<br>And 6ix was going to the University of Maryland at the time, which was right down the street<br>So I'd always go to their dorm room<br>I remember—there was nights I would just crash in the dorm when we was making beats<br>We was doing all types of shit man<br>When we first got out, we did the first Young Sinatra<br>And now we on the fourth Young Sinatra, motherfucker! That shit is crazy man<br>And I remember like, I used to steal quarters from Lenny just so I could go to the 7-11 to eat<br>And he was like, 'You idiot, why are you stealing? Just ask me, bro' And I was supposed to get a job, I was—see, I was sleeping in, uh, his basement on the couch<br>Which is the—the, the cover to my first album, Under Pressure<br>Shout out Cathy, shout out the Rosado family, all my beautiful brown people!<br>We made it, it's crazy<br>But nah, nah, listen, I'm getting ahead of myself, I'm getting ahead of myself<br>So like, I was staying with him and I was supposed to get a job, right?<br>And he was like, 'Yo, you gotta get a fucking job, bro'<br>Things were going so good with the music that we kinda stopped talking about it<br>It seemed like every week something new was happening<br>And I just sat him down one day and I was like, 'Look bro, I—please, like, can you just give me one year, like just give me one year, man, let me put everything into this, and if I don't get it, fuck it, I'll just submit, and I'll just blend into society.'<br>And he was like, 'Bro I'ma give you one year'<br>And for one year him, his family, all his homies, Benny, everybody man!<br>They took care of me, they put—he put clothes on my back, he put food in my stomach<br>You know, he helped me with microphones, and recording<br>And yo, almost a year to the fucking day bro, I signed to Def Jam<br>And my man, he was a land surveyor, out there like making sure all the buildings get built<br>Rain, snow, sleet, all that shit for twelve years, dawg!<br>And when I signed my deal I said, 'Fuck that! Quit your job, we're moving to LA!'<br>This shit was crazy, so we get to LA<br>We're staying off Coldwater Canyon<br>Alta Mesa, in studio city, man<br>And I'm going to the studio with No I.D. every day<br>And uhh, like, shit is crazy<br>That's the first time I met Cole, yo shout out Cole, that's my fucking boy<br>Big Sean, all these homies, man, that I met, it was crazy<br>Don Cannon, everybody<br>That's when I first met Kev<br>Bobby, my engineer—what up Bobby?<br>It was just like, life was insane<br>I dropped, uh, Young Sinatra: Undeniable, and that was crazy<br>That was insane, 'cause that was the first time<br><br>Me and my boys ever hit the road<br>On the real, you know we went from zero to overload<br>Performing in front of the fans, had they hands waving<br>This is all I ever wanted, this is all I'm craving<br>Me and my boy Chris shocked the game<br>Two visionaries on a mission, shit ain't been the same<br>Some ups and downs came around, had a lot of problems<br>But no matter what happen, you know we always solve 'em<br>Yeah, we always solve 'em, like<br><br>Man, it's kinda crazy thinking about it though<br>Like, so much has happened yo<br>And I mean shit, by the time y'all are hearing this, I'm 28<br>I'm 27 while I'm recording it<br>I mean, right now, literally, I'm working on Bobby Tarantino, Ultra 85, Young Sinatra IV<br>And a whole bunch of other shit, man this is crazy!<br>Acting, writing, like<br>I'm just so, I can't believe I'm here, man<br>We grinded for so long, we worked for so long, yo<br>And motherfuckers, they hate you, man<br>They try to make me feel bad about how I look, how I speak<br>How I rap, how I act, my race, my everything<br>They just—they, they fucking hate you man<br>They'll hate you when you in this position<br>But you can't let 'em—you can't let 'em, you can't let that shit get to you man<br>Continue to persevere, continue to be the best you you can be 'Cause I'm here right now man, best friends<br>I got everything I could ever want man<br>Even though you always want more deep down<br>And you got goals deep down, that's great, but fuck that shit<br>I'm so happy, I'm so blessed, man<br>So if you're listening to this right now<br>No matter how old you are, how young you are<br>Whether you on the school bus headed to get your education<br>Or you driving home from work pissed off at your boss<br>Just, man, just please do what you love in life<br>So many people, they always say, how, 'Oh, you know, I would do this—but,' or 'I can't, because'<br>And you already fucking lost, they lost<br>And I felt bad for that person 'cause that person will never make it 'I would, but I don't have the money,' 'I would, but I don't have the time'<br>Fuck that, you gotta do it man<br>You gotta do what makes you happy<br>You have to live selfishly in that aspect<br>Stop worrying about others, stop freaking out<br>Just focus on yourself, man, and your own happiness<br>That's the realest thing<br>And that's all I can tell you, because<br>You can't help anybody else until you help yourself, you know what I'm saying?<br>So please, put the—put the mask on first, like they say on the airplane, 'cus<br>Put your—put your own motherfucking mask on<br>And go do it man<br>Go do it, just live your life<br><br>I love y'all, thank you so much for tuning in<br>Uh, I hope you've enjoyed this Young Sinatra experience, I know I have<br>Uh, this is prolly gon' be the last one though<br>Uh, this gon' be the last one for sure<br>I'm coming back with some fun, but, I don't know<br>I love you guys!
