<dd class="hb0">Flyte are an English alternative-pop band from London, consisting of Will Taylor (lead vocals, guitar), Sam Berridge (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Jon Supran (drums, backing vocals) and Nicolas Hill (bass, backing vocals). <br><br>Debut Album<br><br>In 2017, Flyte flew to Australia to work with Courtney Barnett's producer Burke Reid on their debut album.  Focusing on their live performances and the band's four voices around one microphone, they took their production cues from David Bowie, Nick Drake, The Beatles and Lou Reed. The album, The Loved Ones was released on 25 August 2017.<br>Early Years<br><br>The band began to form when Taylor (vocals, guitar) and Supran (drums, vocals) started playing together age 11 at their local comprehensive school. Later Hill (bass, vocals) joined and then Berridge (keys, vocals) who they discovered singing in the London Underground. Taylor's parents were both English teachers and as a result, the music was infused with literature based themes, the band taking it's name from Sebastian Flyte of Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited.

It was announced in 2013 that the band had been signed by Island Records<br><br>The second single to be released from Flyte 'Light Me Up' was released on Turned Out Nice / Island Records on 17 November 2014.
