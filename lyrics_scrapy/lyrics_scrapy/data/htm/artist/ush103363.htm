<dd class="hb0">Loverboy is a Canadian rock band formed in 1979 in Calgary, Alberta. Loverboy's hit singles, particularly 'Turn Me Loose' and 'Working for the Weekend', have become arena rock staples and are still heard on many classic rock and classic hits radio stations across Canada. The band is based in Vancouver.<br><br>Throughout the 1980s, Loverboy accumulated numerous hit songs in Canada and the United States, earning four multi-platinum albums and selling millions of records. After being rejected by many American record labels, they signed with Columbia/CBS Records Canada and began recording their first album on March 20, 1980. Loverboy's founding members were lead singer Mike Reno, guitarist Paul Dean, keyboardist Doug Johnson, bassist Scott Smith, and drummer Matt Frenette.<br><br><br>In 1990, Loverboy's 'Working for the Weekend' was featured in an extremely popular Saturday Night Live sketch involving Chris Farley and Patrick Swayze auditioning to be Chippendales dancers. The song was also featured in the 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, playing on Rock station V-Rock, as well as the video games Saints Row 2, and Shaun White Snowboarding. It is also featured in the 2001 comedy film Zoolander. The song was also featured, in full, at the end of the Rob Zombie film The Haunted World of El Superbeasto. It was used as the background music to a Diet Pepsi television commercial in which a man is asked what else he would like to experience that is youthful, and he chooses his old van from the 1980s. The song also made a brief appearance in the movie Click. The song was even featured in the third episode of 'Regular Show', Caffeinated Concert Tickets as well as the film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. The song was also used in a Toyota commercial featuring NASCAR driver Kyle Busch driving a 2012 Toyota Camry while singing to the song.<br><br>In 1995, Elf Power's record Vainly Clutching at Phantom Limbs featured a song named 'Loverboy's Demise' which describes a Loverboy concert.<br><br>Several of their songs were featured in the 2001 cult comedy Wet Hot American Summer, which takes place in August 1981. In 2006, 'Turn Me Loose' was featured in the action movie Crank starring Jason Statham.<br><br>An early episode of South Park ('An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig') made multiple references to a fictional Loverboy song, 'Pig and Elephant DNA Just Won't Splice.'<br><br>In Aqua Teen Hunger Force's episode Revenge of the Mooninites, Err uses the 'Foreigner belt' to 'Turn Master Shake Loose' to 'Hot Girls in Love' because he's 'Working for the Weekend'. When it didn't work, it was revealed that 'those are Loverboy songs, and Loverboy has always sucked.' (although Carl said that he saw them at the Madison Square Garden in 1985 and they 'kicked ass'.)<br><br>'The Kid is Hot Tonight' is featured on the soundtrack of MLB 2K9 by 2K Sports and was included in the closing scenes of an episode of cartoon 'American Dad,' titled 'Office Spaceman,' Season 3, Episode 56, May 4, 2008, Production Code 3AJN13, where character Roger posed for a Playgirl magazine photo shoot.<br><br>In an episode of Drew Carey's Green Screen Show, Brad Sherwood remarks to a character called 'Hover-boy', 'I loved your album Get Lucky!'<br><br>In the 2006 independent film A Dog's Breakfast, there is a Loverboy poster on the childhood bedroom wall of Marilyn (played by Kate Hewlett).<br><br>In the 15th episode of season 5 on 30 Rock, 'It's Never too Late for Now,' Scott Adsit's character Pete Hornberger tells Frank Rossitano he was in the band Loverboy for 3 months before leaving the band for a college scholarship in 'TV Budgeting.' The episode includes a brief clip in which Adsit has been digitally inserted into the music video for the song.<br><br>In the 9th episode of 5th season of Scrubs, Todd imitates Mike Reno's performance of 'Working for the Weekend' while attending the air-band 'Cool Cats' audition in the beginning of the episode.<br><br>In November 2013, Will Ferrell, as the character Ron Burgundy, performed Loverboy's 'Working for the Weekend' on Conan calling it the campaign song for embattled Toronto mayor Rob Ford.<br><br>In 2012, a humorous commercial for Mr. Lube oil change shops featured the song 'Turn Me Loose'<br><br>In the second-season episode of Will &amp; Grace 'Secrets and Lays', Grace meets up with a high school boyfriend named Campbell. When he says to Karen that he and Grace saw Loverboy in concert together, Karen's response was to comment that they were both geeks in high school.<br><br>In 2016, the band appeared in a commercial for National Car Rental featuring the song 'Lovin' Every Minute of It.'<br>Band members<br><br>Current members<br><br>    Mike Reno – lead vocals (1979–1988, 1989, 1991–present)<br>    Paul Dean – guitar, backing vocals (1979–1988, 1989, 1991–present)<br>    Doug Johnson – keyboards, backing vocals (1979–1988, 1989, 1991–present)<br>    Matt Frenette – drums (1979–1988, 1989, 1991–present)<br>    Ken 'Spider' Sinnaeve – bass, backing vocals (2001–present)<br><br>Former members<br><br>    Scott Smith – bass, backing vocals (1979–1988, 1989, 1991–2000; died 2000)</dd>
