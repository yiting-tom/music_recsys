<dd class="hb0">Michael Lee Aday (born Marvin Lee Aday; September 27, 1947), better known by his stage name Meat Loaf, is an American musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, and actor.<br><br>His Bat Out of Hell trilogy of albums (consisting of Bat Out of Hell, Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell, and Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose) has sold more than 50 million copies worldwide. Almost 40 years after its release, Bat Out of Hell still sells an estimated 200,000 copies annually and stayed on the charts for over nine years, making it one of the best selling albums in history.<br><br>After he enjoyed success with Bat Out of Hell and Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell and earned a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for the song 'I'd Do Anything for Love', Meat Loaf experienced some initial difficulty establishing a steady career within the United States. However, he has retained iconic status and popularity in Europe, especially the United Kingdom, where he received the 1994 Brit Award for best-selling album and single, appeared in the 1997 film Spice World, and ranks 23rd for the number of weeks spent on the UK charts as of 2006. He ranked 96th on VH1's '100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock'.<br><br>He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with worldwide sales of more than 80 million records. He has also appeared in over 50 movies and television shows, sometimes as himself or as characters resembling his stage persona. His most notable roles include Eddie in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), Robert 'Bob' Paulson in Fight Club (1999), and 'The Lizard' in The 51st State (2002). He has also appeared as a guest actor in television shows such as Monk, Glee, South Park, House, and Tales from the Crypt.<br><br>Meat Loaf discography<br><br>    Stoney &amp; Meatloaf (1971)<br>    Bat Out of Hell (1977)<br>    Dead Ringer (1981)<br>    Midnight at the Lost and Found (1983)<br>    Bad Attitude (1984)<br>    Blind Before I Stop (1986)<br>    Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell (1993)<br>    Welcome to the Neighbourhood (1995)<br>    Couldn't Have Said It Better (2003)<br>    Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose (2006)<br>    Hang Cool Teddy Bear (2010)<br>    Hell in a Handbasket (2011)<br>    Braver Than We Are (2016)</dd>
