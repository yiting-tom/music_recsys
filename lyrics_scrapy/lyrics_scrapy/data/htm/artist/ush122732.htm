<dd class="hb0">The Blow is an American electro pop band comprising Khaela Maricich and Melissa Dyne. Maricich and Dyne write, compose, produce and perform all the music. It was formed as a solo project by Maricich in 2002, and she was joined by Jona Bechtolt, from Yacht, from 2004 to 2007. Melissa Dyne became part of the project in 2007.<br><br>The live shows often incorporate monologues and other performance elements. Melissa Dyne began collaborating with Maricich on the live Blow shows starting in 2007, gradually incorporating her background in installation, sound, and conceptual art into the live show. Dyne performs live from a location off stage. Maricich and Dyne composed and produced an eponymous album for The Blow, released in 2013. They have given a series of artist talks discussing The Blow as a mode of performance art.<br><br>Formation<br><br>The Blow was formed in Olympia, Washington. Maricich's solo music project had previously been called Get the Hell Out of the Way of the Volcano.<br><br>The first Blow releases, Everyday Examples of Humans Facing Straight into The Blow and Don't Do the Bomb Before My Mustache Comes, were made as home recordings by Maricich in 2001. Soon afterwards, Maricich began working with K Records, releasing Bonus Album in 2002 and The Concussive Caress in 2003. Both albums were engineered and produced by Maricich at K Records' Dub Narcotic Studio. The live performance of Concussive Caress was a monologue interspersed with songs, titled Blue Sky vs. Night Sky. Maricich toured the performance extensively in clubs, house parties, and art venues; it was part of Portland Institute of Contemporary Art's TBA festival and was performed at the LTTR Explosion at Art in General in New York. In 2004, Maricich began collabrorating with Jona Bechtolt, and The Blow relocated to Portland. Together they produced two albums, Poor Aim: Love Songs, released in 2004 via States Rights Records/The Slender Means Society (later rereleased by K in 2007), and Paper Television, released on K Records in 2006. The Blow has been based in Brooklyn, NY since 2008.<br><br>In 2011, The Blow began recording a new album about 'someone who is quasi-lesbian and might have gone off the rails.' At performances Maricich claimed that the songs were for Lindsay Lohan's new album. The recording was completed in 2012 and includes guest appearances from Rostam Batmanglij, Bashiri Johnson, Sarab Singh, Mirah Zeitlyn, Rainy Orteca, Brian Patrick Hill, and Brian Taylor.<br><br>The Blow's album titled The Blow was released October 1, 2013 on Brooklyn based indie label Kanine Records.</dd>
