<br>
Jersey City rapper Ransom was originally born in Brooklyn, NY in September 1980. His father's slaying and mother's serious illness forced Ransom to stay in foster care a few years, but he and his mother eventually relocated to Jersey City when he was about eight years old. A lifestyle of selling drugs, which landed him in and out of jail as a teen, ensued; however, the young rapper wanted out. In 2000, he and his friends put up money to buy a recording studio, which initiated his rap career under the moniker Ransom. Not long afterwards, he teamed up with fellow rapper Hitchcock to form the A-Team. Known for their Hardhood Classics street albums, the two became staples on the mixtape circuit in New Jersey, but barely dented the scene in neighboring New York. After a deal with Def Jam didn't pan out, the two went their separate ways around 2006. Ransom did not lose much momentum, constantly appearing on DJ Clue mixtapes as well as shelling out his own, including the Best in the City volumes and Ransom Note. In 2007, Ransom received some press over traded lyrical barbs with Joe Budden, also a Jersey City native, who included a verse from Ransom and Hitchcock on his Mood Muzik 3 mix album, claiming a reunion by the defunct A-Team. Later that year, Ransom geared up to release his 2008 Street Cinema mixtape, distributed via N.Y. indie Babygrande. Ransom also had a much publicized public beef in early 2013 with Nicki Minaj that was reported by MTV and TMZ. Statik Selektah was introduced to music at a young age, experimenting with his parents eight-track machine, cassette recorders, and turntable. By middle school, he was already DJing school functions, but he was inspired to be a true wheels-of-steel artiste after hearing DJ Premier &amp; Funkmaster Flex scratch and mix records on Hot 97fm in New York City. In 2000, Selektah moved back to Massachusetts from New Hampshire to pursue an audio production degree at Boston's New England Institute of Art. Around this time, Statik started to put out his own mixtape series titled Spell My Name Right. In 2003, Statik created ShowOff Marketing, which has had clients such as Reebok, G-Unit Records, Virgin Records, Capital, Universal Records, Diddy s Vote or Die campaign and many others. In 2006, Statik Selektah made Showoff into a record label and put out Termanology's Out the Gate as the label's first release. In 2007, Statik released his first LP, titled Spell My Name Right, and came out with a second, Stick 2 the Script, in 2009, both with Boston label Brick Records. In 2010, Statik Selektah dropped another album, again with Brick, entitled 100 Proof: The Hangover, which reached 37 on Billboards Heatseeker Albums Chart. In 2010, Statik Selektah was featured as a DJ on GTA IV's hip hop radio station The Beat 102.7. He also released the album, Population Control, which featured a hit song called 'Groupie Love' featuring Mac Miller. Population Control, and his follow up Extended Play, were both released via Duck Down Records. Besides dropping his own albums, he also has produced on many other artist's projects, including albums with Freeway, Joey BadAss, Reks, 1982 (with Termanology), Action Bronson and more. Statik currently has a show on Thursday nights on Eminem's Shade 45 XM/Sirus Radio Station. Throughout his career, Ransom has always had the bars but the production aspect has always slacked (or he was just rapping over previously-used beats). Now, thanks to Statik Selektah, Ran has the perfect soundscape to deliver his lyrics. And with the 12-tracks included on The Proposal, Ran selects minimal help with Styles P and Ea$y Money.
