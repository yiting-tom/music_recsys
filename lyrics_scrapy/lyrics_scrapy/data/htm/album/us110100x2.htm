<br>
<br>
Sleeping With Sirens did it the right way: touring non-stop and building their fan base one show at a time. Their first and second albums haven't slowed down. They've graced the cover of Alternative Press 3 times in 9 months, and have played to sold out venues all over the world. The gradual build has created a rock solid foundation. While they have had a steady build with no 'flash in the pan' gimmicks or trends, there is no denying the buzz and momentum of this band. Having toured the USA over 8 times in 2 years, the band has put in their time and hard work supporting bands like Attack Attack!, Asking Alexandria, Of Mice &amp; Men, &amp; Miss May I. The band beautifully showcases their softer side with this acoustic EP, which includes 3 brand new tracks, and 2 versions of their biggest hits, done acoustically. <br><br>1. James Dean &amp; Audrey Hepburn<br>2. Roger Rabbit<br>3. Stomach Tied In Knots<br>4. Don't You Ever Forget About Me<br>5. With Ears To See And Eyes To Hear
