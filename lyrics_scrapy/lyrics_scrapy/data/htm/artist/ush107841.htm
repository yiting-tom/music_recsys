<dd class="hb0">Thomas Luther 'Luke' Bryan (born July 17, 1976) is an American country singer and songwriter. He began his musical career in the mid-2000s, writing songs for his longtime friends from high school, performers Travis Tritt and Billy Currington, and releasing his first Spring Break album. After signing with Capitol Nashville in Nashville, Tennessee in 2007 with his cousin, Chad Christopher Boyd, he released the album I'll Stay Me, which included the singles 'All My Friends Say,' 'We Rode in Trucks,' and 'Country Man.' The follow-up album Doin' My Thing included 'Do I,' which Bryan co-wrote with Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood of Lady Antebellum, and the number one singles 'Rain Is a Good Thing' and 'Someone Else Calling You Baby' on the country charts.<br><br>Tailgates &amp; Tanlines, released in 2011, includes 'Country Girl (Shake It for Me),' and the number one singles 'I Don't Want This Night to End,' 'Drunk on You,' and 'Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye'. Bryan's fourth album, Crash My Party, was released in August 2013 and includes the number one singles 'Crash My Party,' 'That's My Kind of Night,' 'Drink a Beer,' 'Play It Again,' 'Roller Coaster' and 'I See You.' His fifth album, Kill the Lights, was released in August 2015 and its lead single, 'Kick the Dust Up,' became his thirteenth number one song, followed by his fourteenth number one 'Strip It Down.' Bryan co-wrote all of his singles with the exception of 'Drunk on You,' 'Crash My Party,' 'That's My Kind of Night,' 'Drink a Beer,' 'Play It Again,' 'Roller Coaster,' 'Kick the Dust Up' and 'Home Alone Tonight' and co-produced all four albums and one compilation album with Jeff Stevens. Bryan was the recipient of the Academy of Country Music Awards and Country Music Association Awards 'Entertainer of the Year' award. To date, Bryan has sold over 7 million albums and 27 million singles worldwide.<br><br>Music career<br>2006–09: I'll Stay Me<br><br>Soon after his arrival in Nashville, Bryan joined a publishing house in the city. Among his first cuts was the title track of Travis Tritt's 2004 album My Honky Tonk History.<br><br>He was later signed by Capitol Nashville to a recording contract. In the meantime, Bryan co-wrote Billy Currington's single 'Good Directions', which went to number one on the Hot Country Songs chart in mid-2007. Bryan co-wrote his debut single, 'All My Friends Say', with producer Jeff Stevens. This song reached a peak of number 5 on the Hot Country Songs chart. In August 2007, Capitol Nashville released Bryan's debut album, I'll Stay Me. Bryan wrote or co-wrote all but one of its 11 songs. The album's second single, 'We Rode in Trucks', peaked at number 33 while 'Country Man' reached number 10.<br>2009–11: Doin' My Thing<br><br>On March 10, 2009, he released an EP titled Spring Break with All My Friends that featured two new songs, 'Sorority Girls' and 'Take My Drunk Ass Home,' plus an acoustic version of 'All My Friends Say.' After this EP, he released his fourth single, 'Do I' in May 2009. Bryan wrote the song with Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood of Lady Antebellum, whose lead singer Hillary Scott also sings backing vocals on it. The song reached number 2 on the Hot Country Songs chart.<br><br>'Do I' was included on Bryan's second album, Doin' My Thing, which was released in October 2009. Also included on the album was a cover of OneRepublic's 'Apologize'. Bryan wrote the album's next two singles, 'Rain Is a Good Thing' and 'Someone Else Calling You Baby', with Dallas Davidson and Jeff Stevens, respectively. Both of these songs went to number one on the country music charts. AllMusic gave this album a positive review as well, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine considering Bryan more 'relaxed' in comparison to his debut. On February 26, 2010, Bryan released a second EP, titled Spring Break 2...Hangover Edition, which featured three new songs: 'Wild Weekend', 'Cold Beer Drinker', and 'I'm Hungover'.[citation needed] While Bryan is mainly known as a country music singer, he has explored other genres like alternative rock with his cover of 'Apologize'.<br><br>Bryan appeared on the April 18, 2010 episode of Celebrity Apprentice alongside fellow country star Emily West. The task for each team was to make over an up-and-coming country star, with Bryan being selected by team Rocksolid, led by Bill Goldberg, and West being selected by team Tenacity, led by Cyndi Lauper. Bryan's makeover failed to impress the judges, leading to Rocksolid losing the task. Bryan's single 'Rain Is a Good Thing' and West's single 'Blue Sky' were both sold on iTunes, with a month's worth of sales being donated to Lauper's charity, the Stonewall Community Foundation, resulting in $25,000 being raised.<br>2011–13: Tailgates &amp; Tanlines<br><br>Bryan released his third EP, Spring Break 3...It's a Shore Thing, on February 25, 2011, featuring four new songs - 'In Love With the Girl,' 'If You Ain't Here to Party,' 'Shore Thing,' and 'Love In a College Town.' This release was followed by Bryan's seventh single, 'Country Girl (Shake It for Me)', which was released on March 14, 2011. Also co-written by Bryan and Davidson, it served as the lead-off single to his third studio album, Tailgates &amp; Tanlines, which was released August 9, 2011.
