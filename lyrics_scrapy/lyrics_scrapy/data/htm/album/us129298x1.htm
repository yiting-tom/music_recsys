In an age when everything from fashion to furniture reeks of prefabrication, it is rare to find a genuine realness even in soul music. As the one genre of music that should send shivers through ones body while still managing to touch your heart, much of today's R&amp;B feels as though more thought has gone into the choreography than the songs. And then, there is Shareefa. The first soul woman signed to ''Disturbing the Peace''Def Jam, this Newark, New Jersey native introduces her special realness on the debut disc Point of No Return. Recruiting studio vets Chucky Thompson, Salaam Remi (How Good Love Feels), Rodney Jerkins and newcomers the Justice League (Butterfly), the mature voiced twenty-three year old Shareefa has created something special. 'From the first time I stepped into the studio, it was my goal to try and make classic material, ' says the singer. Indeed, with one listen to Shareefa ' s vocal styling and production, it is obvious that Point of No Return stands-up next to such stellar debuts that include What ' s the 411 (Mary J. Blige) and Faith (Faith Evans). Coming on strong with her first single 'Need A Boss,' it's obvious Shareefa has something to say. Produced by Rodney Jerkins, who has constructed past hits for Beyonce and Brandy, this track is the bass heavy jam that is destined for summer song greatness. Riding the rhythm with the confidence of a veteran songstress, 'Need A Boss' also boldly displays Shareefa's talents as a budding songwriter. While all the collaborators on Point of No Return bring something special to the project, there is a definitely connection between Shareefa and producer Chucky Thompson. 'There is something about Chucky that is just eternal,' Chucky produced four ballads for Point of No Return including the amazing 'Trippin.' 'He has a studio in Baltimore where we recorded,'Seductive as she is talented, Shareefa has no problem putting her message across on Point of No Return, be it about love, hate or indifference. 'I'm just straight forward,' informs Shareefa. 'I'm not trying to put across any false images, I'm just being me.' <br><br>1. The Start (Album Version (Explicit))<br>2.
