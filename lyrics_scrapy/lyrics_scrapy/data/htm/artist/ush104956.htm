<dd class="hb0">FM Static is a Canadian Christian pop punk duo based in Toronto, Ontario. The band was formed in 2003 as a side project for Thousand Foot Krutch. The band consists of Trevor McNevan and Steve Augustine. The original lineup included John Bunner on guitar and Justin Smith on bass. As of 2013, the band has released four studio albums, most recently My Brain Says Stop, But My Heart Says Go! (2011).<br><br><br>Career<br><br>Their first album What Are You Waiting For? was produced by Aaron Sprinkle, who also produced Thousand Foot Krutch's album Phenomenon. The album featured the hit singles 'Definitely Maybe', 'Something to Believe In', and 'Crazy Mary'. FM Static toured through 2003 to 2005; John Bunner quickly retired after playing a few shows and so Justin asked his brother Jeremy to fill in for them.<br><br>On August 1, 2006, FM Static released their second album titled Critically Ashamed, which featured the single 'Waste of Time'. Originally, a cover of Vanilla Ice's 'Ice Ice Baby' was to be included on this album, but it was removed later in the production process. The band did not tour in support of their second album because the Smith brothers had stopped playing for them. So FM Static became a two-piece band with studio musicians filling in for the other parts. While their second album featured only the single 'Waste of Time', the songs 'Tonight' and 'Moment of Truth' went on to become huge unadvertised Internet hits, as well as hits on some radio stations. The song 'Tonight' had accumulated over thirteen million hits on YouTube as of November 2011, while 'Moment of Truth' had nearly ten million.<br><br>On April 7, 2009, FM Static released their third studio album Dear Diary. Written as a concept album, it details the fictional story of a boy facing the difficulties of life, love and faith, as told through his diary entries. The entries themselves were released in a blog prior to the album's release, and are included in the CD booklet, accompanied by illustrations drawn by Worth Dying For guitarist Nathan Parrish. This album featured the singles 'Boy Moves to a New Town With An Optimistic Outlook', 'The Unavoidable Battle of Feeling On the Outside', and 'Take Me As I Am'. Trevor announced in a TFK broadcast that FM Static planned to tour again in 2009 to promote the album. This was confirmed when FM Static was added to setlist of the Creation Festival tour alongside TFK as well as Jars of Clay, AA Talks, B.Reith and This Beautiful Republic. Due to the fact the Trevor and Steve could not play all instrumentals, Nick Baumhardt from TFK filled in on the tour, as well as Tom Beaupre on bass and keyboards.<br><br>McNevan also posted on his Twitter account on February 5, 2010, that he is in the process of finishing new songs for FM Static, which will appear on a new record. He stated originally that the album's title would be 4, but he later mentioned on his personal Facebook page that the title had been changed to My Brain Says Stop, But My Heart Says Go.[citation needed] At Lifest 2010, FM Static debuted a song from this album called 'Cinnamon &amp; Lipstick'. On November 23, FM Static released a triple pack called '3 Out of 4 Ain't Bad'.<br><br>On April 5, 2011, FM Static released their fourth studio album My Brain Says Stop, But My Heart Says Go!. Two singles from the album have been released; 'My Brain Says Stop, but My Heart Says Go!' and 'Last Train Home'. Another single from this album, 'F.M.S.T.A.T.I.C.', can be heard in episode 12 of the CW show Hellcats.[citation needed]<br>Members<br><br>    Trevor McNevan - vocals, guitars (2003–present)<br>    Steve Augustine - drums (2003–present)<br><br>Former members<br><br>    John Bunner - guitar (2003)<br>    Justin Smith - bass (2003–2005)<br>    Jeremy Smith - guitar (2004–2005)<br><br>Touring musicians<br><br>    Tom Beaupre - bass, keyboard (2009–2011)<br>    Nick Baumhardt - guitar (2006–2009)<br></dd>
