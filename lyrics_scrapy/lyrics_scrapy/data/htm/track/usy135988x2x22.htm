<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> The Little Match Girl</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>Lyricist：Sarantos<br>Composer：Sarantos<br><br>The Little Match Girl<br>By Hans Christian Andersen<br><br>Most terribly cold it was; it snowed, and was nearly quite dark, and<br>evening-- the last evening of the year. In this cold and darkness there went<br>along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with naked feet.<br><br>When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but what was the good<br>of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had hitherto<br>worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them as she<br>scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that rolled by<br>dreadfully fast.<br><br>One slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid hold of by<br>an urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally for a<br>cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. So the<br>little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet that were quite red and<br>blue from the cold. She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron, and<br>she held a bundle of them in her hand. Nobody had bought anything of her<br>the whole livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.<br><br>She crept along trembling with cold and hunger -- a very picture of sorrow,<br>the poor little thing!<br><br>The flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful curls<br>around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now thought. From<br>all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so deliciously of<br>roast goose, for you know it was New Year's Eve; yes, of that she thought.<br><br>In a corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the<br>other, she seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet she<br>had drawn close up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go home<br>she did not venture, for she had not sold any matches and could not bring<br>a farthing of money: from her father she would certainly get blows, and at<br>home it was cold too, for above her she had only the roof, through which<br>the wind whistled, even though the largest cracks were stopped up with<br>straw and rags.<br><br>Her little hands were almost numbed with cold. Oh! A match might afford<br>her a world of comfort, if she only dared take a single one out of the<br>bundle, draw it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it. She drew one<br>out. 'Rischt!' how it blazed, how it burnt! It was a warm, bright flame, like<br>a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful light. It seemed<br>really to the little maiden as though she were sitting before a large iron<br>stove, with burnished brass feet and a brash ornament at top. The fire<br>burned with such blessed influence; it warmed so delightfully. The little<br>girl had already stretched out her feet to warm them too; but the small<br>flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the remains of the burnt-<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>out match in her hand.<br><br>She rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly, and where the<br>light fell on the wall, there the wall became transparent like a veil, so that<br>she could see into the room. On the table was spread a snow-white<br>tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain service, and the roast goose<br>was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried plums. And<br>what was still more capital to behold was, the goose hopped down from<br>the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its breast, till it<br>came upon the poor little girl; when -- the match went out and nothing<br>but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind. She lighted another match.<br>Now there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree: it<br>was still larger, and more decorated than the one which she had seen<br>through the glass door in the rich merchant's house.<br><br>Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and gaily-<br>colored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop windows, looked down<br>upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them when --<br>the match went out. The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher and<br>higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and formed a<br>long trail of fire.<br><br>'Someone is just dead!' said the little girl; for her only grandmother, the<br>only person who had loved her, and who was now no more, had told her,<br>that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.<br><br>She drew another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the<br>lustre there stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild, and<br>with such an expression of love.<br><br>'Grandmother!' cried the little one. 'Oh, take me with you! You go away<br>when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like the<br>delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!' And she<br>rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for she<br>wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. And the<br>matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than at noon-day:<br>never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and so tall. She<br>took the little maiden, on her arm, and both flew in brightness and in joy<br>so very high, and then above was neither cold, nor hunger, nor anxiety--<br>they were with God.<br><br>But in the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with rosy<br>cheeks and with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen to<br>death on the last evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the child there<br>with her matches, of which one bundle had been burnt. 'She wanted to<br>warm herself,' people said. No one had the slightest suspicion of what<br>beautiful things she had seen; no one even dreamed of the splendor in<br>which, with her grandmother she had entered on the joys of a new year.<br><br>
