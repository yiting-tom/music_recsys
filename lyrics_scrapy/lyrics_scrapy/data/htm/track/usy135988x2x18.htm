<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> The Elves And The Shoemaker</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>Lyricist：Sarantos<br>Composer：Sarantos<br><br>The Elves And The Shoemaker<br>By The Grimm Brothers<br>Margaret Hunt's translation (1884)<br><br>A shoemaker, by no fault of his own, had become so poor that at last he<br>had nothing left but leather for one pair of shoes. So in the evening, he cut<br>out the shoes, which he wished to begin to make the next morning, and as<br>he had a good conscience, he lay down quietly in his bed, commended<br>himself to God, and fell asleep. In the morning, after he had said his<br>prayers, and was just going to sit down to work, the two shoes stood quite<br>finished on his table. He was astounded, and knew not what to say to it. He<br>took the shoes in his hands to observe them closer, and they were so<br>neatly made that there was not one bad stitch in them, just as if they were<br>intended as a masterpiece.<br><br>Soon after, a buyer came in, and as the shoes pleased him so well, he paid<br>more for them than was customary and, with the money, the shoemaker<br>was able to purchase leather for two pairs of shoes. He cut them out at<br>night, and next morning was about to set to work with fresh courage; but<br>he had no need to do so for, when he got up, they were already made, and<br>buyers also were not wanting, who gave him money enough to buy leather<br>for four pairs of shoes. The following morning too, he found the four pairs<br>made; and so it went on constantly — what he cut out in the evening was<br>finished by the morning, so that he soon had his honest independence<br>again, and at last became a wealthy man.<br><br>Now it befell that one evening not long before Christmas, when the man<br>had been cutting out, he said to his wife, before going to bed, 'What think<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>you if we were to stay up tonight to see who it is that lends us this helping<br>hand?' The woman liked the idea, and lighted a candle, and then they hid<br>themselves in a corner of the room, behind some clothes which were<br>hanging up there, and watched. When it was midnight, two pretty little<br>naked men came, sat down by the shoemaker's table, took all the work<br>which was cut out before them and began to stitch, and sew, and hammer<br>so skillfully and so quickly with their little fingers that the shoemaker<br>could not turn away his eyes for astonishment. They did not stop until all<br>was done, and stood finished on the table; and then they ran quickly away.<br><br>Next morning the woman said, 'The little men have made us rich, and we<br>really must show that we are grateful for it. They run about so, and have<br>nothing on, and must be cold. I'll tell thee what I'll do: I will make them<br>little shirts, and coats, and vests, and trousers, and knit both of them a pair<br>of stockings, and do thou, too, make them two little pairs of shoes.' The<br>man said, 'I shall be very glad to do it;' and one night, when everything<br>was ready, they laid their presents all together on the table instead of the<br>cut-out work, and then concealed themselves to see how the little men<br>would behave. At midnight they came bounding in, and wanted to get to<br>work at once, but as they did not find any leather cut out, but only the<br>pretty little articles of clothing, they were at first astonished, and then<br>they showed intense delight. They dressed themselves with the greatest<br>rapidity, putting the pretty clothes on, and singing, 'Now we are boys so<br>fine to see. Why should we longer cobblers be?'<br><br>Then they danced and skipped and leapt over chairs and benches. At last<br>they danced out of doors. From that time forth they came no more, but as<br>long as the shoemaker lived all went well with him, and all his<br>undertakings prospered.<br><br>
