I remember I loved Lord Finesse, all the shit he did with DITC, Diggin in the Crates. 'Hip to the Game', one of like—one of the illest beats ever and I remember when Mac flipped that shit for Kool-Aid and Frozen Pizza—I thought it was the dopest shit man. Mac showed me that I could just do it all on my own—me and all my boys, all my homies— and if it wasn't for him killing that beat I would have never got on that beat for my very first mixtape Young Broke and Infamous. Damn... that's like 2010. And I titled the track 'Young Sinatra.' And that was the birth of all this shit. So, thank you, I appreciate you, love you and miss you, yeah—we just some motherfuckin' KIDS...<br><br>
