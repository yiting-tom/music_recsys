<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> Hallelujah Anyway</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>Hallelujah... Hallelujah...<br><br>I stood in the frame of Mr.Beerbohms door.<br><br>Son this ain't a barn, know what I called you here for? You's the last young bachelor in<br>this place, and it's claimed you give your life for God's grace.<br><br>Mr.Beerbohm you heard it true I love the Lord, my family, and you.<br><br>Son I'm here to prove you wrong, when you see the proof you'll be joining me in song. Your<br>Lord don't know you, your families disgraced, I love you too, so I get you through the gate. I'm<br>old and dried but my daughters clean, Son, are you catching what I mean? I need a male to carry on<br>my name, upon your seed I lay claim.<br><br>But Mr.Beerbohm the doctors say that with your daughter no man can lay. If a child passes from<br>your daughters legs, then she'll pass too, to the end of her days. Mr.Beerbohm what's with that<br>gap-toothed grin? Tobacco spit hanging from your chin.<br><br>Son your Lord works in mysterious ways, but in the end someones got to pay!<br><br>I wanted nothing to do with his word I tripped and ran through the frame of his door. I jumped<br>inside my '41 Ford and I screamed Sanctuary Lord! The building I chose is hummed from within,<br>I knew this was the place that my Lord was in. I put my right foot on the first step of 'The Catholic<br>Name Church', I could hear them calling too me, they sang 1... 2...3...<br><br>Hallelujah... Hallelujah...<br><br>I put my left foot on the next step almost through the door, they sang it louder out for the Lord,<br>they sang 1... 2...3...<br><br>Hallelujah... Hallelujah...<br><br>I screamed my love out for the Lord as I burst and tripped through the frame of the door. I ran<br>hard down the worn-oak aisle and my banished brother from a pew he smiled.<br><br>I didn't steal I borrowed, but the town disagreed, Mr.Beerbohm said, 'Son, come with me.'<br>I brought on our family much disgrace, nice to see my brother own up to his fate.<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br><br>I ran further down the aisle and seen, my stillborn brother that never did breathe.<br><br>Greetings brother, we finally meet, I'm the one who soiled our sweet ma's feet. I fell out hit the<br>ground, Ma and me made no more sound. That's when Beerbohm came, said, 'what a<br>disgrace,' picked me up, brought me to this place... you love your family?...you work for<br>the Lord?...we's both here... you wonder what for?<br><br>I came to the pulpit fell upon my knees, asked, 'Lord, this can't be what you planned for me?' I<br>bent my neck, should I look upon my Lord?<br>I prepared myself for His word. The silence<br>slammed into my head, it burst out my ears and bounced around the black oak walls<br>holding up the Catholic Name Church. But that racket was soft compared to the whack<br>smack his tobacco spit made as it burst upon my forehead. Through his gap-toothed smile<br><br>Mr.Beerbohm spoke his word.<br>You will use your life-work for another, but you will not be pure and clean as your<br>people think is a necessary requirement. You will touch my daughter, she will pass on as<br>you's two's continue my name for me. We all must make sacrifices, however, as luck will<br>have it, it's yours truly who does the choosing. And if you choose to uselessly turn too<br>your obstinance and misguided notions,...I will be there! To titter in your face! And if<br>you still choose to turn away,... I will be there to mock your every move! It's a waste of<br>your talent... truly it's a waste of effort. You think your family is disgraced now? Well,<br>don't get me started. But you can rectify it son. If you show me some grace and acknowledge<br>a stronger power. Put your effort to use son... start by singing.<br><br>That's when I heard them doors open again, saw stick-like teen Miss Lady Beerbohm step<br>gracefully through the doors frame. I looked over her hips that were no wider than my<br>thigh and thought about being unclean with her. I reasoned that I would be fighting the<br>same fight, only in a different manner, with a different weapon. Sometimes people, the only<br>way to win is to admit that you lose. And you'll lose too, that's the only way, but do it with<br>grace and sing Hallelujah Anyway.<br><br>Hallelujah... Hallelujah...<br><br>
