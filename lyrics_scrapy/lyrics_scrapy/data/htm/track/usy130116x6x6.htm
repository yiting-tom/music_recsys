(yesss!)<br>I don't gotta dig deep (deep!)<br>To realize Slim bought Big Proof a big jeep, because he deserved it! (deserved it!)<br>How can I mourn the same way Shady did<br>Over him when he knew him when he attended Osbourne? (YESS!)<br>Marshall, I'm sorry! (SORRY!) - I knew it went left (left!)<br>I ain't into fuckin' my family like incest. (incest!)<br>If you remember Ice, (Ice!) used to be my lifes interest<br>Tell Hailie, my wife just had a princess! (princess!)<br>Since I made up with EM, there's nothin' else<br>That I can move on from, so who wants some? (that's me!)<br>Like a jar of grey (grey!) - poupon!<br>You have to ask anybody in any car - want it or move on?<br><br>[Chorus]<br><br>[Crooked I:]<br>When fans picture my interviews, they think I'm in a swimmin' pool<br>With women who've been abused, so they turn into strippers!<br>Makin they livin' in the nude<br>One in the middle blowin' my inner tube - while the interviewers gettin ridiculed!<br>Is this your vision?

(NIGHTMARE!)<br>As a kid I had 2 steal breakfast<br>An' now tha best question you have to ask me: 'Is this a real necklace? '<br>'Where's ya beat from Dre? Ya feature from Cube? '<br>These things leave people confused!<br>Cause they know I leave speakers abused I eat tha eq's<br>I eat thru tha beat; what's tha secret? I think it's tha shoes!<br>Back in Cali' niggas blaze an stress<br>Waitin' on 'Detox' to save tha West!<br>Hahaha! - Even if tha shit is dope, it ain't givin you niggas hope<br>Unless your signatures wrote on tha check from Interscope. - NOPE. - MOVE ON!
