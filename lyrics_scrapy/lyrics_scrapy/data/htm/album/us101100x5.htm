<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
   Lifehouse is a quality band, perhaps underrated by those who view them only as another mainstream rock act because of their two massive hits this decade. Unsurprisingly, their debut, 'No Name Face,' remains their strongest effort to date. Their next two records were solid and did not disappoint, but they did not wow anybody either. This album, 'Who We Are,' is a step up from the last two, but still does not approach their debut. <br><br>'Disarray' gets the music off to a rocking start the way 'Spin' did for 'Stanley Climbfall.' It's a good sign when the first single, 'First Time,' is not the best song on the album even though it is already a hit. Again, this song is more rock-oriented, a contrast to their softer self-titled album. <br><br>'Whatever It Takes,' would be a decent choice as a third single. Lifehouse has a knack for sounding fresh without necessarily breaking down any musical barriers. None of their songs sound like a rehash of previous works, which is a feat for a band this successful. This track, as well as several others, proves that Jason Wade is one of the better songwriters in music today. <br><br>The title track is a great song with a driving force behind it. The next song, 'Broken,' is the best song on the album and likely to be a huge hit both on mainstream and Christian music radio stations. An emotional, powerful ballad written about one of Wade's friends, this song is an example of how Wade's lyrics can appeal to both the spiritual and secular crowd. <br><br>'The Joke' is upbeat and different, likely to be hit or miss with fans. The second half of the album is filled with tracks that are good but do not match up to the first few songs. The exception is the sublime 'Storm,' an official version of the song Jason Wade wrote early in his songwriting career. Wade's deep vocals are strong enough to carry the first minute of this song without any instrumental accompaniment, and the rest of this song finishes the album on a strong note. <br>
