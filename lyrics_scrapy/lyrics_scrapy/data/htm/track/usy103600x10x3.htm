see the top of the thong<br><br>She a<br>(Bad muh'fucker)<br>She could bass a deuce, a fine-ass Medusa<br>Make your dick turn to stone, take a look at the thong<br>Get in the zone, took a shot of Patron and I was gone<br><br>She a<br>(Bad muh'fucker)<br>Take a look at them hips and how she lickin' them lips<br>Like she was lickin' ice cream<br>Ballin' with a bad bitch that ain't yours on the scene<br>Listenin' to some Al Green might<br>(Make you do wrong)<br><br>That's a girl that you shouldn'ta fucked with<br>But she so seductive, got a nigga head gone<br>Now you know it ain't right, got a girl at home<br>But tonight she the type that'll<br>(Make you do wrong)<br><br>This a nigga that you shouldn'ta fucked with<br>But he so seductive, had a bitch head gone<br>Now you know it ain't

her bang on<br>I don't know what I'ma tell my dawg<br>When he look up and realize that a bitch ain't came home<br><br>Shit, he about to be rockin' it<br>Lookin' sweeter than chocolate, he got the smell of a Reese's<br>Break a fella to pieces, it's a hell of a thesis<br>Adjustin' his body with telekenesis<br><br>Got on top and then he knocked me off, until he was soft<br>Got in the car and
