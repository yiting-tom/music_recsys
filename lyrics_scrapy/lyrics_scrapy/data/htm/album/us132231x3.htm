<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
Dear friend and co-producer, CC Thomas plays some Bass that you will want to listen for over and over again...AND sings some cool background vocals this time around. CC is a partner in Sound Vision recording studios in Harbor City. CC currently plays bass for Jeffrey Osborne.<br><br>Michael Sechrest, dear friend, co-producer and partner in Sound Vision recording studios plays beautiful acoustic and electric guitar. Many cool textured sounds are Michael and his guitars in disguise. Listen for Michael's velvety ad-libs and great blend with Susan Kay on all of the background tracks.<br><br>CC, Michael and Susan Kay vibed together to program the lush strings and layers of intricate sounds that will simply transport you to 'Ahhhh'.<br><br>Susan Kay actually plays some piano on this one, which is how she writes all of her music. And of course, it wouldn't be her without her signature, very hip, and lush background vocals. And boy did they stack 'em up on this one!<br><br>Featured again on this CD is Ming Freeman, keyboard and pianist for Yanni. 'You just know you have to bring in Ming. He channel's amazing!'<br><br>A new addition is Rob Peters on Piano for track 6(When I Fell). 'Rob's interpretation of this song won him a permanent spot in my heart and in this trusted circle of amazing musicians and dear friends I am so blessed with.' says Susan Kay. Rob and his music therapist wife Kasi co-wrote and produced a project with Susan Kay that is a companion CD for the book 'The 12 Gifts of Birth' by Charlene Costanzo. Look for that CD by the end of April 2004. It will feature Susan Kay's angelic voice with children's voices in a musical celebration that will appeal to all ages.
