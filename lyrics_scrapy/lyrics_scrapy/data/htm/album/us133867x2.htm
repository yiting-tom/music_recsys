<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
After a decade, the hugely influential pioneers of Post-Hardcore, Rival Schools are returning with their brand new and much anticipated second album Pedals, set for release on 7 March through Photo Finish/Atlantic Records. The second single from the album, 'Wring It Out' will be released on 6 March. In support of the album they will be hitting the road for four UK co-headline dates with .And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead in April, kicking off at London's Electric Ballroom on 15 April. Achieving musical transcendence is a tricky feat, almost definitively. If it happens at all, it happens naturally - and perhaps nobody knows that better than New York's Rival Schools. Let's rewind a few years - in 2001 Walter Schreifels, Ian Love, Cache Tolman and Sammy Siegler released what would later become their seminal debut album United By Fate. Little did they know that this album would go on to help shape the world of Post-Hardcore and influence hundreds of bands along the way. Now a mere ten years later, Rival Schools have done it again. Pedals not only breaks a decade of recording silence but reminds us and reiterates just why they achieved the success and classic album status that they did. Since reforming in 2008 the foursome has been relentlessly touring all over the US and Europe - perhaps the experience of which, contributed to their even more honed and developed sound on this album. The first single to be released from Pedals, 'Shot After Shot', sets the pace for this record and shows the band together, at the height of their considerable powers. Songs like '69 Guns' and 'Eyes Wide Open' quickly remind us that they still very clearly possess what made them legendary to begin with. There's no doubt there is a definite progression from their debut, it demonstrates 'a greater sense of purpose and band identity' as Schreifels describes. One thing is clear, Pedals is everything fans will expect it to be and more, and without question will open up their musical genius to a whole new generation of fans. This might be the second coming or it could just be a perfect example of a band doing it right once again.
