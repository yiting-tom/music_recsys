<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
   On December 22nd, the official website announced a 'Heartagram Edition' containing the album, an acoustic disc titled 'Baudelaire in Braille' containing all the albums songs, and a limited run of screen prints titled 'Saint Scream'. The second disc 'Baudelaire in Braille' is also available in the 2-disc special edition. Recently, HIM has played several new songs live including 'Heartkiller,' 'Scared To Death,' and 'Love, The Hardest Way.' Clips can be found on YouTube for all 3 songs. <br><br>The album title was inspired by one of frontman 'Ville Valo's relationships that has since ended. He told Kerrang!: 'It's a sonic diary of that (affair). The album's also about both the theoretical and practical aspects of relationships which are an impossible problem to resolve. 'Screamworks' represents a cathartic , primal scream; it's a big middle finger; it's a f--k off, I want to do what I want to do.' <br><br> <br>
