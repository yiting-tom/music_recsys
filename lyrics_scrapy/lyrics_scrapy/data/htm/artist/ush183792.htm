<dd class="hb0">Olivia O'Brien (born November 26, 1999) is an American singer and songwriter. She is best known for her collaboration with gnash on the Billboard Hot 100 top 10 song, 'i hate u, i love u'. She has since released her debut single 'Trust Issues' and two follow-ups, 'Root Beer Float', featuring Blackbear, 'Find What You're Looking For', as well as 'RIP'.<br><br>Early life<br><br>O’Brien was born on November 26, 1999 in Los Angeles, California.

She later attended an online high school, but ultimately decided to drop out to focus on her career. <br>Career<br>2015–2016: Breakthrough<br><br>O'Brien initially gained the attention of gnash after posting a cover of one of his songs on Soundcloud.

Her second single, 'Root Beer Float' featuring blackbear, premiered on September 15, 2016. O'Brien and gnash made their second television performance on September 19, 2016, performing 'i hate u, i love u' on Today.
