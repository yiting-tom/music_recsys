<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
Vinyl LP pressing. 2011 album from the Oxnard-based Indie Rock outfit. Sea Lions formed in 2007 with just Adrian Pillado singing and playing guitar backed by his best friend on drums. The early days of Sea Lions were a learning curve, the duo crashing and bashing their way through songs, often stumbling upon beauty in the process. They were always just teetering on the edge of something great, but then came that greatness came one night at cooler-than-cool LA indie club Part Time Punks. They had recently added a second guitarist and a bass player... and they killed. Pillado had really grown as a songwriter; the songs were still shambolic, but they were also assertive and direct.
