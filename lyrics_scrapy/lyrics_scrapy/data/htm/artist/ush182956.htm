'Glitter &amp; Gold' also reached #1 on the UK Spotify Viral Chart, and #2 on the iTunes Alternative Chart.<br><br>Also in 2015, 'Fire' was selected by film producer Harvey Weinstein to feature in the Bradley Cooper movie 'Burnt' and went on to receive airplay on American rock radio in 2016.

Another track, 'Hobo Rocket', was included on the soundtrack of the EA Sports video game FIFA 17. In early 2017, the It's All Indie website selected Courtney as its #1 Sound of 2017.<br><br>Courtney has opened for artists including The Who, The Libertines, Ed Sheeran, Tom Odell and Fitz and The Tantrums, and opened for Blur at the closing party for the 2016 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. He is currently working on his first full-length album, and will be performing at the BottleRock Napa Valley festival in California, the Governors Ball Music Festival in New York and the LaureLive Music Festival in Cleveland, OH later in 2017.<br><br>In late January he also announced details of an extensive US headlining tour, in addition to the release of his debut EP, The Dull Drums. His song, ''Hellfire', was named as the official theme song for Extreme Rules in 2017.<br><br>In July 2017 his song, 'Fire', was used in the opening scene of Suits (Season 7 Episode 1) . It has been used in the episode of Teen Wolf, (Season 6 Episode 2) as well as in Lucifer (Season 2 Episode 18).<br><br>Throughout the 2017 AFL season, the Hawthorn Football Club used 'Glitter and Gold' with a highlights package over the ground public address system in the final 60 seconds before the start of home games.<br><br>Barns Courtney will be playing at The Riptide Music Festival Dec 2nd on South Florida's beautiful sunny beach, Ft.
