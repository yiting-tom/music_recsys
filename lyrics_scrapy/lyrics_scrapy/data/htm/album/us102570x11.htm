<br>
   Crash Love 是A Fire Inside（AFI）的第8張錄音室專輯，計劃在9月29日經Interscope唱片發行。製作人是Joe McGrath 以及Jacknife Lee。<br><br>06年的Decemberunderground巡演後，AFI用了兩年的時間來創作，還抽空組了幾個編外樂隊，包括貝司手Hunter Burgan的Hunter Revenge，以及重組了他的老樂隊 The Force。主唱Davey Havok 和吉他手 Jade Puget 組了個名為 Blaqk Audio的電聲團體。Havok還趁Puget給專輯混音的空當發佈了一個時裝品牌。08年AFI宣佈已經完成專輯的創作，正和製作人David Bottrill在錄音室加緊專輯的製作。隨後幾個月，樂隊的官網重新設計後上線，發佈了Begin Transmission的主題，邀請歌迷參與錄音帶拍攝以及專輯的合聲。幾千份申請中有5位幸運兒參加了09年2月在洛杉磯Conway Studio的錄製。<br><br>今年2月，AFI和Bottrill關係鬧僵，改由Joe McGrath （Blink-182的製作人）和Jacknife Lee製作他們的新專輯。儘管如此，他們並沒有重寫曲子，還是沿用了已經錄好的部分。和Muse的The Resistance一樣，他們新專輯的曲目也是通過Twitter一首一首公佈的。<br><br>談到這張專輯，貝司手Burgan稱「聽上去更加搖滾。音樂上，比上一張Decemberunderground更能迅速讓人接受。」主唱Havok則說，「我個人覺得沒有哪一張AFI的專輯比這個更棒了……這張專輯會使我們被更多的人記住。」<br><br>首支單曲Medicate在8月25日由iTunes開始數字發行，9月1日開始在電台播出，同時被收錄到了吉他英雄的新作（Guitar Hero 5）裡。專輯的B-Sides也會通過各種渠道發行。<br><br>Interpreted by UkoO™ novadust <br><br>UKoO novadust㊣原創翻譯 轉載註明<br><br>=========== 原英文介紹 =========== <br><br>Crash Love is the upcoming eighth studio album by the rock band AFI. Produced by Joe McGrath and Jacknife Lee, it is scheduled for release on September 29, 2009 through Interscope Records.<br><br>Following the touring cycle for 2006's Decemberunderground, AFI spent two years writing and recording their next album while also working on a number of side projects: bassist Hunter Burgan started Hunter Revenge and briefly reunited with his old band The Force, while singer Davey Havok and guitarist Jade Puget recorded and performed as the electronic act Blaqk Audio. Havok also launched a fashion line while Puget worked on remixing and production for other musical artists. In November 2008 AFI announced that they had finished writing their next album and would be recording it with producer David Bottrill. The following month the band's official website was redesigned and relaunched, and a contest entitled 'Begin Transmission' was announced in which fans were invited to submit homemade videos to be considered for a spot to record backing vocals on the album. Thousands of entries were received and personally reviewed by the band members, and the five winners recorded their parts with the band at Conway Studios in Los Angeles in February 2009.<br><br>In January 2009 AFI split with Bottrill in favor of producers Joe McGrath (who had worked with Morrissey, Alkaline Trio, and Blink-182) and Jacknife Lee. However, they continued working on the same songs and did not abandon any of the material that had already been recorded. The album's title was announced as Crash Love in February 2009, and in July its release date was set as September 29. A viral marketing campaign was used to reveal the album's tracks, with songs announced one-by-one on the band's website as fans sent messages to a Twitter account. The full track listing and album art were reported by various music publications on August 21.<br><br>Speaking about the album's sound, Burgan remarked that 'This is definitely more of a rock album–more immediate and definitely more of a focused, direct approach musically. Compared to Decemberunderground, where some of the songs were more subtle, these are more in-your-face.' In announcing the completion of Crash Love, Havok stated that 'personally, I've never been more proud of an AFI record.' '. . .but it definitely feels like that's what we've achieved: created the album by which we'll be remembered', stated Havok in an interview done with Total Assault.<br><br>The album's first single, 'Medicate', became available for purchase through iTunes on August 25, 2009, was released to radio stations September 1, and is included as a playable track in the video game Guitar Hero 5. Several b-sides will also be available through iTunes, which will offer both regular and deluxe editions of the album: 'Too Late for Gods' and 'Breathing Towers to Heaven' are available with pre-orders, while the deluxe edition also includes exclusive versions of both of these songs plus '100 words', 'Fainting Spells', 'We've Got the Knife', and 'Where We Used to Play'. <br>
