<br>
<br>
Sculptured was fashioned in the Summer of 1996 by Don Anderson, with an inspiration to create interesting and challenging music, Don immediately began writing material for what would become the three song demo, 'Fulfillment In Tragedy'. A drummer was called upon; John Schlegel, which Don had known for years. The disciplined duo spent weeks crafting the songs, 'Lit By The Light Of Morning', 'Words of Silent Fowler' and 'Our Illuminated Tomb' for recording during the last, cold Winter months of the year. Two studio musicians were called upon to contribute their genius. Brian Yager complemented the music with his lush clean vocals, and trumpet jazz musician Burke Harris laid down some fine solos. Once the demo was released it gained momentous positive feedback from magazines around the world which lead to a 2 CD deal with Mad Lion Records from Poland. The debut CD would contain the same three songs from the demo as well as four new ones including the mysterious demo title song 'Fulfillment In Tragedy'. The debut CD, 'The Spear of the Lily is Aureoled' is now available. Prior to the CD release Mad Lion secured an American/Japan licensing deal with The End Records. After the recording of the CD, new members had been recruited to allow Sculptured be a live act. Nick Wusz joined in on guitar and Jason Walton of Sussurus Inanis and Nothing fame has offered his bass work. Sculptured has declared war on the ironies of love. Through rich, melodic music and lyrics detailing the catastrophic way in which humans treat each other through the horrid burden of romance, Sculptured will soon see the light of morning and be rest assured that true love is but a sharp and quick arrow away...
