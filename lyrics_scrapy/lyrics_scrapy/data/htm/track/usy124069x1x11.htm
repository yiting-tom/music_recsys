<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> What If Punk Never Happened</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>Well on a cold Tuesday morning, I was walking into town*<br>Had my headphones blaring, didn't notice what was around,<br>I crossed the road, a car swerved and nearly ran me down,<br>Looked in the driver's seat, I swear to God it was Doc Brown,<br>He said 'Are you Michael J Fox?' I said 'No I'm Jonny Fox',<br>He said 'Close enough, get inside,<br>I'm taking you with me to see another time,<br>A place you could only have dreamed in your mind,<br>An alternative reality situated just outside of Clapham,<br>So strap yourself in,<br>Cos where we're going you don't need roads,<br>To get to where punk never happened'<br><br>We landed in a concrete desert, rubble as far as the eye could see,<br>I says to Doc 'Where we goin'?'<br>Doc says he's following me,<br>We found the only building in the city that was left standing,<br>It was my local venue,<br>I know cos I recognised the landing,<br>And there's a gig on tonight! This town ain't so bad,<br>I got everything I need, right here in this pad,<br>So I pulled out a bottle and took a heroic swig,<br>Made myself comfortable and got ready for the gig,<br><br>Well an hour after doors and there was still no-one there,<br>The soundman was on acid, the fucking long hair,<br>The bands never showed cos they didn't see the point,<br>When all the kids are at home still smoking a joint,<br>They won't go out and do nothing, not on your nelly,<br>They're just watching the telly and then feeding their belly,<br>Their parents listen to The Beatles, while they listen to Nirvana,<br>Cos Green Day and The Pistols, well they never heard either,<br><br>They got long sleeve T-shirts and they never shower,<br>They still believe in flower power,<br>The hippy dream's faded but they got nothing new,<br>So they wear flares and slippers and burn incense sticks too,<br>The kids would rather skate than go out and smash the state,<br>While their parents sit still and meditate,<br>Action's at a low when people just don't care,<br>They zoned out to their surroundings, the anger's not there,<br><br>And I'm stuck in this hippy, grunge reality,<br>Where the buildings are crumbling down from apathy,<br>They grab you at school when you've just turned 13,<br>And show you your brand new, life long routine,<br>You can sleep and work, and work and sleep,<br>So you can save up the money to buy a new jeep,<br>So you can sleep and work, and work and sleep,<br>Then sleep. Then work. Then work. Then sleep.<br><br>I pulled a fanzine out my back pocket, held it in my hands,<br>And watched the colours slowly fade away,<br>The words bled right off of the pages til it had nothing left to say,<br>I banged on the jukebox but it was useless,<br>It had no good records on,<br>Not even something weak like 'The Best Punk Album In The World Ever Volume 1',<br>Outside the windows, I saw the excavators coming to tear the place down,<br>No-one stopped them, for there is no community left in this town,<br>There's no-one around to fight Margaret Thatcher,<br>The power of the flower just couldn't match her,<br><br>Too strong was the will of Parliament to cause damage,<br>That with no punk rock everything went unchallenged,<br>Land got knocked down to build more land,<br>That got knocked down again for a couple more grand,<br>With no punk the protests were full of throwbacks calling each other comrade,<br>Of course the young folks' attendance started to fade,<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>So it was easy for the police to move in, they were trusted,<br>And that's when the whole damn town got busted,<br><br>They moved CCTV cameras in everywhere,<br>But the people were too apathetic to care,<br>They made them carry ID cards to state where they're from,<br>As if by being born they had done something wrong,<br>They shipped all the poor folk to live out in the edges,<br>So the rich folk could move in and peer over their hedges,<br>'But before you leave, you'd better build our homes,<br>There, we've done you a favour, now you're on your own,<br>This ain't your home no more, go find somewhere new,<br>I know you ain't got the money, cos it's me who employs you,<br>I know everything about you, what you eat, how you dress,<br>Your hobbies, your turn-ons, your email address,<br>While I had you working in the dark, you didn't realise,<br>That I completely stopped your ability to organise,<br>I didn't let you have a reason to communicate,<br>I banned punk rock knowing you hippies would seal your own fate,<br>I controlled everything you wrote, everything you created,<br>I distracted you with advertisements so you forgot what you hated,<br>I fed your dark side, kept you consuming and competing,<br>And like a dog that doesn't know when to stop eating,<br>You took it all, oh and long was it my intention,<br>You could have beat me if punk rock was your invention',<br>Instead the city will be sold to the highest bids,<br>If only Sham 69 had of united the kids,<br><br>If only the 4 Skins had told us ACAB,<br>If only The Ramones had let us know we were a happy family,<br>If only The Buzzcocks had shown us how to do it ourself,<br>If only Crass had shown us there are things more important than wealth,<br>If only The Vandals had shown us it was OK to smile,<br>If only The Dead Kennedys had helped us put our government on trial,<br>If only Rancid had played live, and brought with them that vibe,<br>If we had Sick Of It All and Madball we could put them all on the frontline,<br><br>If we had GG Allin we'd have learned it's OK to be hated,<br>If we'd have had The Refused then we could have innovated,<br>If we'd had Poison Idea then they couldn't push us over,<br>If we'd had Minor Threat then we could have done it sober,<br>If we'd have had Against Me we could have done it all unplugged,<br>If we'd had Operation Ivy we could have done it then fucked off,<br>If we had The Blitz, The Clash, Disorder, Propagandhi,<br>The Exploited, NOFX and anyone that's handy,<br><br>There's a lesson to be learned, one that I will take home,<br>When I return to my normal reality zone,<br>Punk rock has the power to change the world,<br>It lies in every single punk rock boy and girl,<br>So don't let anyone tell you you're not worth the earth,<br>These streets are your streets, this turf is your turf,<br>Don't let anyone tell you that you've got to give in,<br>Cos you can make a difference, you can change everything,<br>Just let your dreams be your pilot, your imagination your fuel,<br>Tear up the book and write your own damn rules,<br>Use all that heart, hope and soul that you've got,<br>And the love and the rage that you feel in your gut,<br>And realise that the other world that you're always looking for,<br>Lies right here in front of us, just outside this door,<br>And it's up to you to go out there and paint the canvas,<br>After all, you were put on the earth to do this,<br>So shine your light so bright that all can see,<br>Take pride in being whoever the fuck you want to be,<br>Throw your fist in the air in solidarity,<br>And shout 'Viva la punk, just one life, anarchy'.<br><br>
