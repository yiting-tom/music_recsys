It's a beautiful day<br><br>[Verse:]<br>I used to complain about my financial state, career shit<br>My girl trouble, now I don't hear shit<br>Peep this story, I went to work just to clear my desk<br>And say goodbye to all the folks I left<br>Then I seen my man, who always showed up to work with a smile<br>We would kick it at lunchtime and I admired his style<br>He was excited everyday, he was the first one there<br>And we would always roll together though he rolled in a chair with wheels<br>'cause he ain't walk in like about 3 years<br>he said the accident had happened when he had a few beers<br>arguing with his wife, he never told me the story<br>until the day I looked defeated and he said that's when I needed it<br>I asked him why he's always happy as Hell<br>he said he's happy as Heaven with a story to tell<br>He said: 'Me and my girl was fightin' maybe she suspected cheatin'<br>'cause I was, I was buzzed and there's times I almost beat her<br>but I didn't, we was newlyweds, tight from junior high<br>I was raised in Crown Heights, she grew up in Do or die<br>and the night we was beefing, dog I ain't gon' even lie<br>I said I hate u she said 'why don't you die?'<br>I didn't mean it, but she checked my phone<br>I was driving on the road, she like 'who the hell is this?'<br>how am I supposed to know?<br>'It's that bitch you be with, nigga call her right now'<br>I'm like chill girl calm the fuck down<br>put your seat belt on, tears in her eyes 'how can you be so wrong?<br>You still fucking her?' I'm like nah, not really<br>She swinging, I'm laughing, til she caught me in the eye<br>I couldn't see, tried to switch lanes fast I said I tried<br>'cause the next thing I know, I saw clouds in the sky<br>I was laying on my back there was cars passing by<br>heard the sirens, noise, wilding I was doing more than 60<br>some people say God was with me<br>I say he's always there, even though my girl looked so scared<br>she started shaking on the stretcher then the next 90 seconds<br>I was in the hospital, with the doc giving blessings<br>said my legs stopped working and my lady she was pregnant<br>and we mighta saved the baby, what baby?? I was stressing like<br>save my lady we'll make another baby!!<br>but we never got the chance<br>never said I love you all I got was a glance<br>life can't be this bad, yes it can!<br>I was thinking at first<br>she passed and it couldn't be worse<br>I went into trauma, my mama came<br>some nights inside my brain I dream I could've saved her but the dream just fades<br>they tell me imma walk one day, and I can feel it<br>2 weeks ago, my right knee cap got back the feeling<br>and my ankle started twitching dog this is not a game<br>that's why I laugh when y'all be crying and complaining<br>and I ain't saying you sound stupid<br>but that day I met the boss<br>you told me keep my fingers crossed and you knew I couldn't do it<br>You beef about blocks you be trooping<br>Life is hard but I ain't making excuses<br>I just pray, I don't cry, I don't ask God why<br>I watched my wife die, but He kept me alive and now<br>I can still see her smile as I stare in my daughter's eyes<br>and say thanks for my child yo everyday is a good day.'<br><br>
