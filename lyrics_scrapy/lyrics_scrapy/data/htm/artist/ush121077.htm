<dd class="hb9">Luther Vandross【 20 albums 336 lyrics 】</dd>
<dd class="hb0">Luther Ronzoni Vandross Jr. (April 20, 1951 – July 1, 2005) was an American singer, songwriter and record producer. Throughout his career, Vandross was an in-demand background vocalist for several different artists including Judy Collins, Chaka Khan, Bette Midler, Diana Ross, David Bowie, Barbra Streisand, Ben E. King, and Donna Summer. He later became a lead singer of the group Change, which released its gold-certified debut album, The Glow of Love, in 1980 on Warner Bros. Records. After Vandross left the group, he was signed to Epic Records as a solo artist and released his debut solo album, Never Too Much, in 1981.<br><br>His hit songs include 'Never Too Much', 'Here and Now', 'Any Love', 'Power of Love/Love Power', 'I Can Make It Better' and 'For You to Love'. Many of his songs were covers of original music by other artists such as 'If This World Were Mine' (duet with Cheryl Lynn), 'Since I Lost My Baby', 'Superstar' and 'Always and Forever'. Duets such as 'The Closer I Get to You' with Beyoncé, 'Endless Love' with Mariah Carey and 'The Best Things in Life Are Free' with Janet Jackson were all hit songs in his career.<br><br>During his career, Vandross sold over 35 million records worldwide, and received eight Grammy Awards including Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance four different times. He won a total of four Grammy Awards in 2004 including the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for a song recorded not long before his death, 'Dance with My Father'.<br><br>Discography<br>Main article: Luther Vandross discography<br><br>    Luther (1976)<br>    This Close To You (1977)<br>    Never Too Much (1981)<br>    Forever, for Always, for Love (1982)<br>    Busy Body (1983)<br>    The Night I Fell in Love (1985)<br>    Give Me the Reason (1986)<br>    Any Love (1988)<br>    Power of Love (1991)<br>    Never Let Me Go (1993)<br>    Songs (1994)<br>    This Is Christmas (1995)<br>    Your Secret Love (1996)<br>    I Know (1998)<br>    Luther Vandross (2001)<br>    Dance with My Father (2003)<br></dd>
