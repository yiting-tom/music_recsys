<dd class="hb0">Amaranthe (/ˈæmərænθ/ AM-ə-ranth) is a Swedish heavy metal band, originally known as Avalanche. The band is notable for having three lead vocalists: Elize Ryd, Henrik Englund Wilhemsson, and Nils Molin, each presenting a different vocal style.<br><br>History<br><br>Formed by Olof Mörck (Dragonland, Nightrage) and Joacim 'Jake E' Lundberg (Dreamland, Dream Evil) in 2008, the project began taking shape when singers Elize Ryd (toured with Kamelot) and Andreas Solveström (Cipher System, Within Y) signed on, as did drummer Morten Løwe Sørensen (The Cleansing, Koldborn, Mercenary). Bassist Johan Andreassen (Engel) joined after the photoshoot for the Leave Everything Behind demo but before the recording of the first album Amaranthe. The band was originally called Avalanche, until May 2009, when the band was forced to change their name, due to legal issues. The members chose to rename the band Amaranthe. They later released their first demo, Leave Everything Behind.<br><br>The band's debut album, Amaranthe, was released in April 2011 and reached a peak position of 35th on Swedish charts and 16th on Finnish Charts. Their second album, The Nexus, was released in March 2013. Guitarist Olof Mörck described the album as having greater contrasts, a more controversial mix of genres, and featuring more creative freedoms than Amaranthe. According to Olof, the band 'took everything [up] to eleven' in the new album. The album reached 6th on Swedish charts, 4th on Finnish charts, and reached a peak of 12th on the US Heatseekers charts.<br><br>In October 2013, harsh vocalist Solveström left the band and was replaced by Henrik Englund Wilhemsson (Scarpoint). Their third album, Massive Addictive, was released on 21 October 2014. A special compilation Breaking Point - B-sides 2011-2015 was released on 30 October 2015. It consists b-sides and bonus tracks from Amaranthe's career. Their fourth album, Maximalism, was released on October 21, 2016.<br><br>In November 2016, male clean vocalist Jake E announced that he would take a break from the band. In February 2017, he decided to make his departure permanent. In March 2017, he joined the new band CyHra. In July 2017, Amaranthe stated on their Facebook page that Nils Molin of Dynazty would join the band as their permanent vocalist, after filling in for Jake E on tour dates.<br>Musical style<br><br>Reviews of Amaranthe's style are varied, though they all acknowledge that they are mainly a subgenre of metal. According to AllMusic, Amaranthe's musical style mixes death metal with melodic pop music, giving for a feel of metalcore overall. Lead singer Elize Ryd acknowledges the difficulties in trying to ascribe their music to one specific genre and describes Amaranthe's sound as 'dance-metal with a taste of death and modern/melodic metal,' though she admits that, unlike death metal, their focus is on 'positive energy' and 'open[ing] up minds [and] give[ing] passion, strength and love'. MusicMight classifies the band as melodic death metal and power metal. Sputnikmusic's overview of the band refers to them as an outfit that is a hybrid of metalcore and power metal, more specifically, combining heavy riffs and breakdowns with Ryd's 'soaring vocals.'<br>Band members<br><br>Current members<br><br>    Olof Mörck - guitars, keyboards (2008–present), bass (2008-2009)<br>    Elize Ryd - female clean vocals (2008–present)<br>    Morten Løwe Sørensen - drums (2009–present)<br>    Johan Andreassen - bass (2010–present)<br>    Henrik Englund Wilhemsson - unclean vocals (2013–present)<br>    Nils Molin - male clean vocals (2017–present)<br><br>	<br><br>Former members<br><br>    Joacim 'Jake E' Lundberg - male clean vocals (2008–2017)(Current Band: CyHra)<br>    Andreas Solveström - unclean vocals (2008-2013)<br><br>Former touring members<br><br>    Antony Hämäläinen - unclean vocals, live (2012)<br>    Anna-Mia Bonde - female clean vocals, live (2011)<br>    Richard Sjunnesson – unclean vocals, live (2011-2012)<br>    Olle Ekman - unclean vocals, live (2015)<br>    Alexander Strandell - male clean vocals, live (2016)<br>    Chris Adam Hedman Sörbye - male clean vocals, live (2016–2017)<br></dd>
