<dd class="hb0">Harvey Leigh Cantwell (born 28 January 1999 in Kent, England), also known by his stage name HRVY, is an English Pop singer and TV presenter. He was a presenter on BBC's Friday Download on CBBC from Series 7 to Series 9<br><br><br>In his teenage years he was encouraged by friends to upload videos of his performances to Facebook, and in 2013, with the help of manager Blair Dreelan (former vocalist of pop group East 17), he was soon performing live and quickly signing with Universal Music. HRVY's first single, 'Thank You,' was released in late 2013 and became a huge hit. Among various tours, appearances, single releases, and other pop star activities, Cantwell appeared occasionally as a guest presenter on BBC television show Friday Download, and signed on as a full-time host in 2016. He regularly uploaded videos to his YouTube channel, including frequent cover songs and collaborations with other pop stars. In 2017 he released his Holiday EP, which included the hit single 'Phobia,' among other tracks. ~ Fred Thomas</dd>
