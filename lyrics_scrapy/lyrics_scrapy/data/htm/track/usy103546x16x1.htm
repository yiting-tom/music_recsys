up to the cop<br>So on the way to the studio we go 'bout makin' another hot track<br>They be lovin the way that we spin it when we try commentin' lots<br><br>And approach to the definition of a soldier<br>My opposition is the my cultural future<br>I split like atomic and anybody MOY I'ma fond of make<br>Me and my killer guerrillas willin' 'cause we're the corner boys<br><br>They tryin to battle 'cause they want our position<br>But they ain't never gettin' in it, because the music is bigger here<br>Like I told you we're number one competitors dealin'<br>We'll connect with them to the top<br>And then we'll stop till they get the millions<br><br>In the hone of the century they been walkin' the limbo<br>Chemistry you can never cross with them<br>Thinkin' inside that they either be as a mean ever polite<br>[Incomprehensible]<br><br>You can try to read us, you can try to beat us<br>Try to get your speed up but it ain't gon' matter<br>'Cause after we get bendin' bustin there gon' be
