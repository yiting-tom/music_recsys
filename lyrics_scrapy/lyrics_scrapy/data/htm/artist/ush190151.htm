<dd class="hb0">Artist Julius Dubose (born December 6, 1995), better known by his stage name A Boogie wit da Hoodie (or simply A Boogie), is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter from Highbridge, Bronx, New York City. He is signed to Highbridge the Label and Atlantic Records. He is best known for his breakout solo single, 'My Shit', from his debut mixtape Artist (2016).<br><br>Career<br>2016: Career beginnings<br><br>Dubose released his first song when he was ninteen. The song, titled 'Temporary' was produced by Myster Whyte. The song took months to make due to Dubose's perceived lack of rap flow at the time. Dubose hired a singing coach to help improve his singing voice and soon finished 'Temporary.'<br><br>In 2015, Dubose moved to New York in an attempt to start making hip-hop his full time career. He and rapper, Quincy “QP” Acheampong then created the Highbridge label and set up a home studio. A Boogie released his first full-length project, a mixtape titled Artist, in February 2016, which launched his career and was on Forbes list of up-and-coming rappers. The mixtape was recorded during a time where Dubose was dealing with a difficult break-up which helped influence the mixtape and Dubose's future sound all together.<br><br>Dubose then released a collaborative project, alongside fellow Highbridge-based rapper Don Q, titled Highbridge the Label: The Takeover Vol.1, on May 18, 2016. Dubose went on to have three opening dates on Drake and Future's Summer Sixteen Tour. In July 2016, A Boogie signed a deal with Atlantic Records. In September 2016, he was featured on the BET Hip Hop Awards cypher alongside Don Q, Russ, Kent Jones and Nick Grant. Later in October 2016, A Boogie released his first extended play (EP), titled TBA, in acronym for 'The Bigger Artist'. The EP peaked at number 63 on the US Billboard 200 chart and appeared on Rolling Stone magazine's 40 Best Rap Albums of 2016 list.<br>2017–present: The Bigger Artist<br><br>On June 13, 2017, Dubose was named as one of the ten of XXL's '2017 Freshman Class'. On September 29, 2017, he released his debut studio album, The Bigger Artist, featuring guest appearances from Chris Brown, Trey Songz, Kodak Black, 21 Savage, PnB Rock and YoungBoy Never Broke Again. The album's lead single, 'Drowning' featuring Kodak Black, has peaked at number 38 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and became his highest charting single in the country so far.</dd>
