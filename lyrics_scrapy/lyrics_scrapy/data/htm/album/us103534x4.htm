<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
   This is the record that a lot of people never thought would happen: A brand new Taking Back Sunday album that features the same line-up as the band's platinum-selling 2002 debut Tell All Your Friends. Although the players here - frontman Adam Lazzara, guitarists Eddie Reyes and John Nolan, drummer Mark O'Connell and bassist Shaun Cooper - are the same, it's important to point out that this album isn't a sequel to this band's debut as much as it is the beginning of a new chapter of innovation and productivity from this celebrated Long Island rock act.<br><br>What began with the simple idea of all five members coming together at the Sonic Ranch in the border town of Tornillo, Texas (near El Paso), last year quickly resulted in a sonic windfall that saw the band writing nearly a dozen songs - and from there Taking Back Sunday never looked back. 'The whole experience of us getting back together was really freeing,' Lazzara explains. 'We went into all of this knowing that our music didn't have to sound a certain way, so we just decided to see what happens and this is what came of it.' Nolan adds, 'I think we all knew that we had to take this band to a place where it hadn't been before for it to really work; it couldn't all be about nostalgia.'<br><br>Let's face it, it would be simple for Taking Back Sunday to get back together solely in order to embark on an anniversary tour for Tell All Your Friends, but despite their previous successes they are quick to point out this record is a brand new beast that is ushering in a different era for the band. 'This album isn't us trying to be something we're not,' Lazzara summarizes, 'it's just us and I'm really proud of that.' If you listen to Taking Back Sunday with an open mind, you'll agree that it is an important record that marks a giant leap forward for a band that truly defies categorization. <br>
