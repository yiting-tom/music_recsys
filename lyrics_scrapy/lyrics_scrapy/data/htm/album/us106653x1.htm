<br>
<br>
   Not many bands can say that they made their Warped Tour and MTV Total Request Live debut in 2008. Syracuse, NY based band HONOR BRIGHT is one of the few. They made their impact after releasing 'If This Was A Movie', a gang-vocal-filled pop-punk EP recorded and produced by John Naclerio (credits include My Chemical Romance, The Ataris and Brand New). <br><br>MTV's staff hand selected Honor Bright to perform on their flagship music program where they played an acoustic version of the song 'Home Is A Heartache'. The album version features guest vocals by Justin Wiley from The Morning Of. The MTV segment, 'On Your Radar' showcases unsigned bands that MTV feels deserve a spot in the national spotlight. Honor Bright played alongside NeverShoutNever and Millionaires. <br><br>Popular music destination Purevolume.com followed, featuring the unsigned act as an editorial feature on their site and Honor Bright dominated the Most Downloaded charts - reaching number one for several days in a row. <br><br>As the band gets regular comparisons to All Time Low and Mayday Parade, it's no surprise that they've received attention from national media such as Amp Magazine, who featured the band in their '21 Young Guns Salute', and several compilations alongside the likes of Four Year Strong, Hit The Lights, Valencia, All Time Low, and Every Avenue. <br><br>The self-released debut album 'Build Hearts From Stars' was released in 2007 and after selling out of the initial pressing was picked up by hometown indie label Aux Records. Aux issued the deluxe edition of Builds Hearts in December 2008 at a show supporting Forever The Sickest Kids, with whom they shared the stage with at the Warped Tour earlier in the year. <br><br>To date the band has spent time on the road in a third of the US and has had their full-length delivered to college radio stations through five states in the northeast. Honor Bright has had the opportunity to play shows with the likes of: Anberlin, Cartel, Mayday Parade, Boys Like Girls, Four Year Strong, Bayside, Powerspace, Forever The Sickest Kids, The Audition and many other fantastic bands. <br>
