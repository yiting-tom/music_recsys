Luckyiam.PSC, MURS：]<br><br><br>[Intro：~Luckyiam.PSC~ {*talking*}]<br>Man, I can't believe that dude came up to me talkin'*<br>He had the audacity to think that was like, cool or somethin'<br>Just all up in my ear, talkin' all that game<br>Yap yap yap yap yap<br><br>[Verse 1: ~Luckyiam.PSC~]<br>When the path of some discussions change up like percussion<br>The tempo of some conversations leave me out in limbo<br>Here's something<br>You might have been through<br>Or maybe, you haven't been through<br>It's simple<br>To be the devil's advocate with your opinions<br>True stories<br>They never bore me<br>The true, they don't ignore me<br>It's amazing when they think they know you so well<br>To tell the tales<br>Foot in their mouths<br>Packed with negativity<br>Talkin' about my family, thinkin' that it's just you and me<br>No, I'm not Corey<br>And no Corey ain't Tom<br>And no your smoke ain't the bomb<br>Ain't tryin' to put you on in the mix of things<br>Tricks they got, keen eyesight<br>They focus upon those in magazine's that hold mics<br>Alright, up in the bull's eye, dodgin' all the bullshit<br>Holdin' onto sanity, stay away from full clips<br>These two tricks approached me one day after one show<br>And said, 'Yo, I like your flow. But man, you really should go solo.'<br>I took a pause<br>Let the lighter ignite my beadie<br>Then I turned around and slapped them little fools with my CD<br>On me, don't ever walk up and disrespect my brothers<br>Unless, you want some trouble from a rather peaceful brother<br>A wrong turn, made in an effort to rub elbows<br>First impressions stick like bitch covered in Elmer's (glue)<br>'Ahh, it sticks'<br><br>[Chorus:]<br>It's the outlandish things they wanna say to me<br>Who do you claim to be? You're just ashamed of me<br>You want to hit us with your gossip but you're really out of pocket<br>Take your mouth and lock it<br>Zip it<br>Stop it<br>The outlandish things they wanna say to me<br>Who do you claim to be? You're like the same to we<br>Too many slick at the lip when they can't skip it towards me<br>With the ideas they had<br>Most of them just bore me<br><br>[Verse 2: ~The Grouch~]<br>Now I do take criticisms like shits and flush 'em<br>Undeservin' egos<br>Me? I crush 'em<br>Hush 'em in the cock pit for snubbin' up my folks<br>Crackin' jokes<br>Laughin' at the stories we collected like some soaps<br>I'm the fuck off the ropes cause I never listen hard<br>When Four Track tapes might has well have been barred<br>You gained a foot I gained a yard<br>You're in the door, I built a second floor<br>When you hand me a flier to my own show I'm steppin' more<br>Faster<br>Protectin' mine like masters<br>I didn't ask for your opinion<br>Why would I? You're beginnin'<br>Or else you're on your way out<br>Seein' the light as it fades out<br>Yours is over here<br>Fork it over dear<br>That's my money<br>When you start actin' funny then I know it is<br>And when they say I sound like someone else they must be blowin'<br>His dick (slurp slurp)<br>And he knows you're a jerk because he told me<br>And when we do a song, then you're gonna have to like me<br>And if you only like me, then you're gonna have to like him<br>That's the way we're writin'<br>Signin' off, A Titan<br><br>[Chorus:]<br>It's the outlandish things they wanna say to me<br>Who do you claim to be? You're just ashamed of me<br>You want to hit us with your gossip but you're really out of pocket<br>Take your mouth and lock it<br>Zip it<br>Stop it<br>The outlandish things they wanna say to me<br>Who do you claim to be? You're just ashamed of me<br>You want to hit us with your gossip but you're really out of pocket<br>Take your mouth and lock it<br>Zip it<br><br>[Verse 3: ~MURS~]<br>Bitch said, 'The Grouch? Uuuuah!<br>Doesn't he still live with his mom and make beats in the basement? Duuh?<br>Aren't Tom and Corey a little too old to be rapping?<br>I mean it's all good and everything because you see, you're young<br>But I used to go to parties back at um, 4001<br>Don't you think about the future? I mean it used to be cool<br>But what about going jobs and goin' to school?'<br>'Bitch, look at your life! Ain't you shootin' porn?'<br>Ain't nothin' worse than a fuckin' groupie scorn<br>Speakin' on my crew, like that's not my family<br>You should really watch for who, you choose to speak candidly<br>Cause I'm a tattle tale<br>Bout to e-mail the crew with them words you just said<br>Should have gave me (skull) instead of talkin' head<br>Now you got me walkin' Fed Express towards the exit<br>Just like I had a motor<br>But first I crossed paths with this dick head promoter<br>'Aye aye, you need to do my club.'<br>Knows I rock for free cause I do it for the love<br>I said, 'Please don't curse<br>L-O-V-E, shit that's a four letter word<br>So I'ma let you know just in case you haven't heard<br>I don't MC for free<br>And that's period<br>So if it ain't doe, then I'm really not hearin' it.'<br>'Oh you gotta be jokin'.'<br>'Hell, naw I'm serious<br>Respect my authori-tie<br>And quit ignorin' my receipt for dues paid<br>I mean, who's brigade was you really tryin' to ask?<br>I mean, that shit is in the past<br>Rockin' shows for petty cash<br>I already mashed on your homie<br>For comin' at me the wrong way.'<br>It's about to be a long day<br>I exit the wrong way in an attempt to escape<br>The fools out front beggin' for the free tape<br>Cause my name's on the bill<br>They think I'm full blown<br>But I also got my name on some bills at home<br>And I can't pay for shit with a dope freestyle<br>Beadie breath and a smile is all you gettin' from me<br>So when you disappointed by that wack show that you see<br>Just think to yourself, 'FUCK! I should've just bought a Good Music CD.'<br><br>
