<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> Ballad Of The Broken Word</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>Lyricist：Toshi Reagon<br><br>No taxation without representation<br>Two hundred years of exploitation<br>In the capital of this nation<br><br>No representation in the capital of this nation<br>Two hundred years of exploitation<br>Give the people their right to vote<br><br>Someone asked me, was it true?<br>The voting rights of the district were long overdue?<br>They couldn't believe it when I said a yes<br>And then I said, 'A, you ain't heard nothing yet'<br><br>We are based in Washington DC<br>A truly diverse community<br>Almost six hundred thousand strong<br>Have been exploited much too long<br><br>Inadequate power over our own affairs<br>And national issues for which we care<br>No votes in Congress, the Senate, the House<br>No state delegation, no representation<br><br>We pledge allegiance, Army country 'tis of thee<br>Fight in wars, pay taxes in this country<br>Provide work and services for the government<br>We get no vote but our money is spent<br><br>You may wonder, how in the world can this be?<br>I thought we lived in a democracy<br>The US constitution gives equal protection<br>Check the 14th amendment to make this connection<br><br>No taxation without representation<br>Two hundred years of exploitation<br>In the capital of this nation<br><br>No representation in the capital of this nation<br>Two hundred years of exploitation<br>Give the people their right to vote<br><br>In 1787 the US constitution was ratified<br>US Congress won the power to exclusively exercise<br>In all cases, legislation<br>Over the future capital of this nation<br><br>In 1790, selection of the district site began<br>Using a piece of Virginia and a piece of Maryland<br>Forming the district of Columbia, or Washington DC<br>But the people kept on voting in their former states, you see<br><br>In 1800, Congress took control of DC<br>Ended representation for the whole community<br>In the history of this country you'll find the reason why<br>And even in a new millennium, they want this law to apply<br><br>In 1846, the portion of DC<br>From Virginia decided to retrocede<br>It was returned to the original state line<br>Alexandria and Arlington came after this time<br><br>In 1871, an elected delegate with no vote<br>Was created for the House of Representatives, no joke<br>DC was given territorial government that year<br>Representation remained an issue, do you hear?<br><br>In 1874, financial troubles arise<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>The position of nonvoting delegate meets its demise<br>The territorial government that was given to DC<br>Was taken back by Congress at this point of history<br><br>In 1970, the House brings the position back<br>Years of civil rights activism brought pressure with no slack<br>A step in the right direction brought the people so much joy<br>And the man in this position, was Walter Faunteroy<br><br>In 1978, Congress finally said okay<br>To the DC Voting Rights Act, but not right away<br>If approved within seven years with no hesitation<br>DC would be granted full representation<br><br>In 1985, our hopes were really, really high<br>We knew that they should not let this bill die<br>All we needed was approval of thirty eight states<br>But only sixteen states would support our case<br><br>In 1993, the District made a giant step<br>Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton worked hard to get<br>A DC Vote on the House floor, which Congress did approve<br>But when Republicans came to power, the decision was overruled<br><br>No taxation without representation<br>Two hundred years of exploitation<br>In the capital of this nation<br><br>No representation in the capital of this nation<br>Two hundred years of exploitation<br>Give the people their right to vote<br><br>Now, I'm sure you are wondering what can be done?<br>There are at least four ways that this fight can be won<br>Some suggest we retrocede as a part of Maryland<br>Become a city or county in that state once again<br><br>Or a new law could pass with a Congressional vote<br>DC residents would be counted in the Maryland vote<br>For Federal elections, census taking without retroceding back<br>This would leave our residency in tact<br><br>Or, Congress could pass another law for DC<br>Like they did in 1800 when they took over totally<br>For more than five hundred reasons they treat us like a state<br>And adding another reason, should not a problem create<br><br>This would give us two US Senate seats<br>And the census would determine the number of House seats<br>Preferably, DC would be the 51st state<br>We'd have a seat in the House and two in the Senate, it's not too late<br><br>Democracy is what we want<br>Voting rights are what we need<br>Tell your Congress person, it's time to take heed<br><br>Democracy is what we want<br>Voting rights are what we need<br>Tell your Congress person, it's time to take heed<br><br>No taxation without representation<br>Two hundred years of exploitation<br>In the capital of this nation<br><br>No representation in the capital of this nation<br>Two hundred years of exploitation<br>Give the people their right to vote<br><br>
