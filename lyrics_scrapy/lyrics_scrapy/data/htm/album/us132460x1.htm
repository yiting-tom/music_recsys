<br>
The three remaining members of Tonystark are on a mission to formalize a new blueprint that will pave the way of all music to come. Bound to ooze into the minds of people throughout the whole music industry, the luscious rich melodies for which they were known for are still carried out by the trio, but in a different form. We present to you a new breed of oil……Synthetic 16.<br><br>Formed in the Spring of 1999 by three of the five remaining members of Tonystark, Synthetic 16 is still holding on to the vision of creating a new, sensual form of music, which will embody the ability to touch the inner souls of many.<br><br>After the demise of Tonystark, Synthetic 16 was finally ready to begin on their new and exciting venture of creating brand new material. In order to accomplish this, they quickly realized that they would need to obtain the missing link that would complete the new mixture. That missing link would be the creative and well-established bass player, Mike Trzesinski (Ex-System Fault). The delicate blend was now complete and now consists of Wayne- Drums, Pete- Guitar, John- Vocals, and Mike- Bass.<br><br>The year 2000 proved to be an exciting and busy year for the band. For most of the year, they continued to play shows in the New York area on a regular basis. They left the East Coast in early July to spend a week in Arizona. Several radio stations created opportunities for the band to perform out West which included a rare live television appearance on the FOX Television Network. The tour out West also Included a few shows with the UK pop band, Modern English. Once back home, the band prepared for the fall release of their debut album entitled “Your Water.” With the release finally available to the masses, Synthetic16 will look to support their album with numerous shows in the tri-state area. A U.S. tour is currently in the works for early next year so stay tuned… <br><br>1. Blew<br>2. Sleep Forever<br>3. Your Water<br>4. Army Ants<br>5. More Than This<br>6. Never Get To Know<br>7.
