<dd class="hb0">Gary Allan Herzberg (born December 5, 1967), known professionally as Gary Allan, is an American country music artist.<br><br>Signed to Decca Records in 1996, Allan made his country music debut with the release of his single 'Her Man', the lead-off to his gold-certified debut album Used Heart for Sale, which was released in 1996 on Decca. His second album, It Would Be You, followed in 1998. Allan's third album, Smoke Rings in the Dark, was his first one for MCA Nashville (to which he has been signed ever since) and his first platinum album. His next albums, Alright Guy (2001) and See If I Care (2003), both were also certified platinum while Tough All Over (2005) and Greatest Hits (2007) were both certified gold. His seventh studio album, Living Hard, was released later in 2007. His next two albums Get Off on the Pain and Set You Free, were released in 2010 and 2013 respectively and both reached the Top 10 on the Top Country Albums charts, with the latter reaching number one.<br><br>Overall, Allan's nine studio and Greatest Hits albums have produced 26 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including four Number Ones: 'Man to Man', 'Tough Little Boys' (both 2003), 'Nothing On but the Radio' (2004), and 'Every Storm (Runs Out of Rain)' (2013). Seven more of his singles have reached the Top 10 on this chart as well: 'Her Man', 'It Would Be You', 'Right Where I Need to Be', 'The One', 'Best I Ever Had' (a cover of a song by Vertical Horizon), 'Life Ain't Always Beautiful', and 'Watching Airplanes'.<br><br><br>Discography<br>Main article: Gary Allan discography<br>Studio albums<br><br>    Used Heart for Sale (1996)<br>    It Would Be You (1998)<br>    Smoke Rings in the Dark (1999)<br>    Alright Guy (2001)<br>    See If I Care (2003)<br>    Tough All Over (2005)<br>    Living Hard (2007)<br>    Get Off on the Pain (2010)<br>    Set You Free (2013)<br>    TBA (2017)<br><br>Compilation albums<br><br>    Greatest Hits (2007)<br>    Icon (2012)<br><br>Number one singles<br><br>    'Man to Man'<br>    'Tough Little Boys'<br>    'Nothing On but the Radio'<br>    'Every Storm (Runs Out of Rain)'</dd>
