<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
Repressing. Originally released in 1995 this was their first album for three years and their first album of new TVPs material on Overground Records, who had previously issued two live albums, and reissued nine of their singles. Featuring 11 tracks, the album was recorded by Liam Watson at Toe Rag Studios and was a marked change of direction from the highly polished Closer To God. This was the last TVPs album of original material. Albums since have been either compilations or consisted of cover versions, and as such I Was A Mod Before You Was A Mod remains a remarkable testament to an extraordinary talent. Overground.
