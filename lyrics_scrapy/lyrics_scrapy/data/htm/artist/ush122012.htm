<dd class="hb0">Taylor Dayne (born Leslie Wunderman on March 7, 1962), is an American singer-songwriter and actress. With a career spanning three decades, Taylor's debut single, 'Tell It to My Heart', turned her into an overnight international star in 1987. She followed the smash hit with seventeen Top 20 singles over the course of her three decade career, including number ones 'Love Will Lead You Back', 'Prove Your Love', and 'I'll Always Love You'.<br><br>Taylor has sold over 75 million albums and singles worldwide, earned three Grammy nominations, an American Music Award, and multiple New York Music Awards. She has also received New York Hall of Fame honors and ranked as the number 18 Female Dance artist of all time by Rolling Stone magazine. She is one of the very few artists in musical history to successfully crossover into almost every musical genre and chart with hit singles in Pop, Dance, R&amp;B, Adult Contemporary, and Rock. She has topped the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart three times. In December 2016, Billboard magazine ranked her as the 28th most successful dance artist of all time. </dd>
