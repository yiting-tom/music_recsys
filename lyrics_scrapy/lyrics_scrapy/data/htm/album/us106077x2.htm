<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
   There are a few catchy beats here and there, a passionate vocal once or twice, sometimes a tuneful melody, but that is all. Shontelle's 'No Gravity' is positively earthbound. <br><br>The great majority of these tracks sound like Rihanna B-sides. The beats sound almost identical throughout, and the lyrics are repeatedly bland and canned. <br><br>Only formulaic lead single 'Impossible' has an above-average melody that is worth more than one or two spins. The problem is that, like much of the album, it feigns originality and real emotion. Through the lyrics, the singing, the production and the videoclip, the song has been manufactured to appear serious and passionate when it is, in actuality, totally calculated. A close listen reveals there is no emotional pulse or punch inside it. It has no inner life, only outer life - ideal for mainstream acceptance in 2010. <br><br>In spite of her chosen occupation and her hard work and luck, Shontelle is a totally unremarkable singer. 'Say Hello to Goodbye' is the best example - when she sings ''cause it's gone forever/no more try, you and I, not now not ever' is when her voice sounds its weakest. <br><br>Her vocals run ragged pretty quickly because her vocal range is clearly very limited. In the 70s neither she nor Rihanna would have ever gotten past the front door of a record company's corporate offices. <br><br>When she tries to display passion on the likes of the bouncy, flighty, paint-by-numbers 'Helpless,' the Darkchild-helmed 'Perfect Nightmare' and even the somewhat pleasing 'Love Shop,' she sounds more like an inexperienced high school girl who fantasizes about real love and emotions rather than a grown woman who has actually experienced these feelings. It is simply because she is not emotive enough to be a substantial singer. She sounds the most invested in the title track, the song she co-wrote. <br><br>The-Dream is certainly talented, but everything he has been churning out for the last two years has sounded irritatingly similar no matter who he is working with, and his 'T-Shirt' collaboration here fits that mold perfectly. He has a nice, sonically-pleasing trick up his sleeve, but that trick has run its course. It's time for any - any - change in his sound. <br><br>'No Gravity' is an oxymoronic album because it is absolutely defined by gravity. It takes no risks and offers no passion, grit or soul. It is just another grab-bag of songs tossed off by a record company sung by a mediocre talent. <br>
