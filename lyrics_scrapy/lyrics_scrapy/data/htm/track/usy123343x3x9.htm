<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> Sixteen Straws</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>One Sunday morning<br>While I was out walking<br>By the Brisbane's waters<br>I chanced to stray<br>There I found a prisoner<br>Layed half in the water<br>He'd seen me coming<br>And he began to say<br><br>'I was a native of Erin's Ireland<br>And before I was brought<br>To this terrible place<br>They dragged me away<br>From my wife and newborn<br>And my ailing parents<br>I've been a prisoner at Port Macquarie<br>Norfolk Island and Emu Plains<br>At Castle Hill and cursed Toongabbie<br>At all of these settlements<br>I've worked in chains<br>But of all the places of condemnation<br>At each penal station of New South Wales<br>To Moreton Bay I've found no equal<br>The tyranny there makes all the rest pale<br><br>There I met O'Brien<br>The defender from Ulster<br>He'd left Ireland burning<br>Came here for the wake<br>He was a schemer<br>A Jacobite nightmare<br>He could not be broken<br>But he became displaced<br>The Jew had one hand<br>He was a violent man<br>He'd worn the 20 pound irons<br>Since before time began<br>Just before the dawn broke<br>His starvation awoke<br>He'd pick the corn from the filth<br>He'd find laying around<br>There ain't no walls at all<br>So remote is the North<br>The Commandant Logan<br>Was the devil for sure<br>His chief flogger was mad<br>I heard a prison guard say<br>He'd wash his lash in a bucket<br>Then drinks the remains<br><br>Well I heard a rumour<br>In the barracks one night<br>The Jew and O'Brien had fashioned a knife<br>They meant to kill Logan<br>But my will was broke<br>My brain reeled with this secret<br>And the next day I spoke<br>They put me back on the gang<br>With no word of my actions<br>O'Brien and the Jew<br>Got 300 lashes<br>O'Brien came off his triangle<br>With exposed shoulder blades<br>His skin never healed<br>He turned morbid and strange<br><br>We was out on the road gang<br>Just digging a hole<br>I was struggling with conscience<br>My nerves had dissolved<br>To 15 pairs of eyes<br>O'Brien proposed,<br>'Shall we go to the gallows<br>Be done with our woes?<br>You know the game<br>Fair play's all I'm asking<br>We'll draw 16 straws then nothing is wanting<br>Why should we grasp at the<br>straws of our lives<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>When we're only condemned by our will to survive?'<br><br>16 straws we did then did draw<br>I picked the long one<br>The Jew picked the short<br>He said 'pray God forgives you<br>At least make it quick'<br>14 pairs of eyes watched me<br>Pounding a a shiv through his heart<br>And for a few moments there was no<br>stopping the blood<br>Then O'Brien said 'friends!<br>On a scaffold this ends<br>But it's a long was to Brisbane<br>And we are dangerous men'<br><br>Well Logan was wild<br>We filled him with bile<br>He'd seen the Catholic dodge<br>Plain suicide<br>We'd ascended his powers<br>But not that of the King's<br>Or the judge down the river's<br>But we was happy to swing<br>We were marched through the scrub<br>Off to Brisbane for trial<br>Chained into a whaler<br>Set off at low tide<br>With 6 nervous marines<br>And 6 Enfield rifles<br>The arse end of the world<br>And indifferent blue sky<br><br>Well I turned to torpor<br>At the stern in the sun<br>But I gathered the others must have come undone<br>I woke breathing smoke in a chaos of limbs<br>A red coat squirting blood<br>Through a hole in his chin<br>And a volley of fire in my general direction<br>There was panic and shot<br>And the smell of powder burning<br>I threw a rifle up over the side<br>It was dark by the water<br>But I could see the shore lights<br>Crouched down in the back<br>The wrong side of the guns<br>Getting scorched by the powder<br>I thought surely I'm done<br>I seen ghoulish things<br>Men show limb from limb<br>O'Brien was dead<br>There were pieces of him<br>I tore off my shirt<br>I was quite badly burnt<br>My eyes poured like well springs<br>They were swollen and hurt<br>I'm not sure who survived<br>My whole trunk was on fire<br>But they borke the chains off me<br>And I bailed over the side.'<br><br>Well I was amazed by this poor wretch's tale<br>I'd heard not of the friends<br>He had left in the whaler<br>But I'd just seen the paper<br>and I had to explain<br>How his Commander Logan<br>had died just this day<br>'He'd set out behind you<br>He was out hunting game<br>When he startled some natives<br>Took a spear through his brain'<br>Then the prisoner said 'good'<br>I heard someone in boots<br>I turned around and that's when<br>The Royal Marines came<br><br>
