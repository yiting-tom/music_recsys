<dd class="hb0">Archy Ivan Marshall (born 24 August 1994), also known by his stage name King Krule, is an English singer, rapper, songwriter, record producer and musician.<br><br>He began recording music in 2010 under the moniker Zoo Kid. The following year he adopted his present name. He has released several EPs, and his debut full-length album, 6 Feet Beneath the Moon, was released in 2013 to positive critical reception. He released his second album, The OOZ, on 13 October 2017.<br><br>His music blends elements of punk jazz with hip hop, darkwave and trip hop.<br><br>Career<br><br>During Marshall's years at Forest Hill School and then at the Brit School alongside long-time collaborator Jamie Isaac between 2008 and 2011, he released two singles as 'Zoo Kid'. He created a genre of music called 'Bluewave' and its form was realised in the mixtape entitled 'U.F.O.W.A.V.E'. In July 2011, Archy began playing under a new moniker, King Krule, at a festival in Hyères, France. Later that year he released his eponymous debut EP. His stage name is inspired by the Elvis Presley' film King Creole and not King K. Rool, the character from the Donkey Kong video game series, as previously reported <br><br>On 9 December 2012, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for the Sound of 2013 poll.<br><br>King Krule released his debut album 6 Feet Beneath the Moon on 24 August 2013. More than half of the tracks were already released on his precedent EPs. This brought him to prominence especially in the USA, with performances on Conan and the Late Show with David Letterman. In October of the same year, he embarked on a European tour, which was the last time he has appeared in the UK on tour to date. Following the success of this tour, he then moved on to a tour of North America.<br><br>On 8 January 2014, he released a video for A Lizard State which gained over 800,000 views on YouTube. After a short break, he went on to tour Europe once again, inexplicably missing out on his homeland of the United Kingdom, which was his most recent public performance.<br><br>In February 2014, King Krule appeared on the cover of The Fader in its 90th issue.<br><br>In December 2015, under the name Archy Marshall, Marshall released an album titled A New Place 2 Drown, an album that includes 12 songs, a 208 page book of visual art and text and a ten minute documentary. Marshall partnered with his brother, Jack Marshall, on this project. In an interview with NPR, Marshall says that he wanted the album to have a physical component, as well as something for the eyes and the ears. Marshall released the album under Archy Marshall rather than King Krule to differentiate between the two different genres of music, as Marshall claims that he thought of A New Place 2 Drown as a hip hop album rather than the dark alternative/jazz sound of 6 Feet Beneath the Moon.<br><br>Marshall took to NTS Radio, hosted by Mount Kimbie, and released two songs under his name Edgar the Beatmaker. The first song is an untitled number, and the second song is titled 'When and Why'.<br><br>In August 2017, Marshall released a new song entitled 'Czech One'. It was a King Krule release; the first since the release of his debut album in 2013.<br><br>In September 2017, Marshall released a new song entited 'Dum Surfer'. It was released under King Krule.<br><br>On 13 October, Marshall released his second full album The Ooz under King Krule. The album included the singles released within the previous two months as well as 17 new songs. The album received high reviews, ranking it the #83 most discussed album of 2017 and the #75 most shared album of 2017. The album ranked 23 out of 100 on Official Chart Ranking and was ranked 8.7 out of 10 based on 56 ratings.<br><br>Marshall has received high praise from many popular artists, such as Beyonce and Frank Ocean, who are fond of his dark jazz vibes, Ocean even proposing to do a collaboration with Marshall.</dd>
