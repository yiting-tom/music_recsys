<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> Black Dahlia</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>[Intro：Natalia Kills]<br>You should write a song where the concept is…<br>You're basically writing like a love letter, or like a piece of advice<br>To your mother, when she was your age<br><br>[Bridge: Angel Haze]<br>I don't know<br>Maybe I would write you a happy ending<br>I would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning<br>I would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you<br>And let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you<br>Or maybe I'm naïve…<br>Maybe I'm just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed<br>It would somehow grow inside you<br><br>[Verse 1: Angel Haze]<br>Spent so much of my time wishing you were different<br>But reality is that, where life could never be provisioned<br>But if I could wish for one thing, I'd go back and I'd fix it<br>I'd tackle all your obstacles and kill them with precision<br>And better the intentions of every single person<br>Who play a part in you learning exactly what your worth is<br>I'd shower you with purpose, I'd wipe hate off the surface<br>I'd reshape all your pain and make it fucking worth it<br>No more feeling worthless, no more fucking searching<br>No more of that fraud shit, nobody else could hurt you<br>Yeah, said nobody else could hurt you<br>And if they ever tried too I'd wipe 'em from the Earth too<br>Cuz I know that you hurting baby, I know that you tired too<br>I know that you been running from everything that's behind you<br>I know that you've been burying everything deep inside you<br>I can see it killing you, wish that I could revive you<br>But I'm stuck sitting in this time frame<br>Struggling with my demons and playing these stupid mind game<br>One day it could get better, maybe it could get better<br>Maybe we could change shit, no more inclement weather<br>Know you hated your mom, know it went through your mind<br>You were just like me, wish that you had more time<br>To see life from a different angle, wrestle with a different angel<br>Wouldn't lose your wings and fall from heaven like a cliffhanger<br><br>[Verse 2: Angel Haze]<br>Everything is different now, nothing is the same<br>And nowadays I swear it feels like you don't know my name<br>But I look at the mirror and I see you every day<br>I'm you in every way, every hue and every shade<br>And maybe you should know, it's the last thing that I wanted<br>Cuz what I hate about you makes me feel like I'm haunted<br>And I don't wanna spend the rest of my time on the run and-<br>So I'm just gonna confront it, yeah I'm just gonna confront it<br>And tell you that I love you for everything you made me<br>And that you need to hear this even if it makes you angry<br>God lives inside you, you've already found him<br>The Devil lives in memories and you just let him hound you<br>And I despise the church for everything that they taught you<br>It's just a fucking stain that I wish I could wipe off you<br>That I wish I could wipe off you<br>And I forgive you for doing everything that it cost you<br>Everything that it cost you<br>Fame is such a heavy price I wish it didn't cost you<br>Losing a part of me that would follow you to Hell<br>Follow you to hatred, or follow you to jail<br>Followed you to patterns that I could never get out of<br>Now I realize that I could never make it with that love<br>Now I realize that shit is the alternative outcome<br>Never wanted you to save me, I just wish I count some<br>I just wish that you grew up with someone you could count on<br>I just wish you knew that you could never make it without love<br>For your goddamn self, and that you never ever find it in anybody else<br>Cuz I would help you find you<br>And if I saw it killing you I swear I would revive you<br>And if that meant the end of me<br>I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy end and peace<br><br>[Bridge 2: Natalia Kills]<br>Because, you are such a special thing<br>You're not just my mom, but you're the reason I exist<br>And the best life that you could've had for yourself without making a mistake<br>Would have meant I woulda had a nicer childhood<br>And even though my childhood wasn't perfect and I still love you<br>I just want you to know that if I could go back do one thing for you<br>I would be one person for you<br>I would make sure, not just for my sake, but so that you could've had a nicer life<br>And a nicer childhood, that you know<br>You would not have made the mistakes that put us all in this bad situation<br>And not have the stress to leave<br>But just so that you would have been happier and stronger<br>Even if I didn't exist, even it meant that I was never born<br>That's what I would have wanted for you<br><br>[Verse 3: Angel Haze]<br>Yeah, and if that meant the end of me<br>I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy ending<br>Cuz I know that you hurting baby, I know that you tired too<br>I know you've been running from everything that's behind you<br>I know that you've been burying everything deep inside you<br>I can see it killing you, wish that I could revive you<br>And if that meant the end of me<br>I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy ending<br>And if that meant the end of me<br>I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy ending<br>And if that meant the end of me<br>I'd do it all for you so you could have your happy ending<br><br>[Outro: Angel Haze]<br>I don't know<br>Maybe I would write you a happy ending<br>I would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning<br>I would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you<br>And let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you<br>Or maybe I'm naïve…<br>Maybe I'm just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed<br>It would somehow grow inside you<br>And that I could hide you from the rain<br>So that it could be easier for happiness to find you<br>Or maybe I'm still a kid who's caught in a dream<br>I'm the heir to the throne of a princess who's still trying to be queen<br>Or maybe we're all just caught in the winds of a massacre<br>The blackened leaves of dying, black dahlias<br><br>
