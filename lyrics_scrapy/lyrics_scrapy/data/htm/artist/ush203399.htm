<dd class="hb0">One Voice Children's Choir (originally known as the 2002 Winter Olympic Children's Choir and Studio A Children's Choir) is an American children's choir in Utah.<br><br>The group was founded by Masa Fukuda in 2001 after he composed the song 'It Just Takes Love' for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. He asked students to help make a commemorative CD for the Olympics. Some of the students also were 'children of light' performers for the Olympics, whom he volunteered to help train. After the Olympics, 25 students wanted to continue singing together, and Fukuda formed the choir as a nonprofit organization to continue working with them.<br><br>One Voice is led by director Fukuda and has 140 members ages 4–17. Every year, the choir perform around 50 to 70 times. The group meets year-round for once-a-week practices. They perform a vast selection of music such as pop music, gospel music, classical music, Broadway musical songs, and patriotic songs.<br><br>In 2003, the choir sang the Christmas song 'Innocence of Youth' and won the John Lennon International Music Award after singing in a competition for Yoko Ono. In 2014, One Voice received national attention for their rendition of the Disney song 'Let It Go', starring Lexi Walker and Alex Boyé. Their video received 1 million views in one day, 18 million in 10 days, and over 60 million by July 2015. They were invited to compete in the ninth season of America's Got Talent in 2014 and reached the quarterfinals.</dd>
