<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
   You've cer­tainly accom­plished some­thing if you make pop-rock unap­peal­ing. Normally, with pop records, you can expect soar­ing cho­ruses, huge hooks and air­tight pro­duc­tion. Even the most embar­rass­ing and scene bands can cre­ate songs that are irre­sistibly infec­tious (i.e. Forever The Sickest Kids' 「Woah Oh!」). However, The Bigger Lights' debut album falls well short of genre norms. While the pro­duc­tion is there, the hooks and over­all appeal is not. Ultimately, the band's effort is well below the aver­age pop album. For those look­ing for good pop-rock or a fun guilty plea­sure, look else­where; The Bigger Lights' self-titled effort is def­i­nitely not what you are look­ing for.<br><br>While the band shows some poten­tial, they devi­ate lit­tle from a stan­dard for­mula, there­fore cre­at­ing a very generic and plas­tic record. The album's open­ing track, 「That Kind of Girl」, is mis­lead­ing; it is not an indi­ca­tor to come. This opener turns out to be one of the lone bright spots, sport­ing an okay hook and catchy cho­rus. Other decent tracks include 「What About Us」 and the pre­vi­ously released 「Queen Of Broken Hearts.」 They are not pop per­fec­tion, but they do demon­strate the band's poten­tial to write solid songs. Aside from these offer­ings, the rest of the record is the epit­ome of mediocre. They are highly for­get­table and do lit­tle to dis­tin­guish them­selves from one another. The hooks and cho­ruses are not grand enough to draw in the audi­ence. In addi­tion, the lyrics are excep­tion­ally trite, relat­ing atyp­i­cal song top­ics such as sum­mer, women and par­ty­ing. The Bigger Lights do try to branch out with the bal­lad 「Always」. However, the bal­lad lacks lyri­cal prowess and impres­sive vocals. Like the rest of the album, the song is a below aver­age attempt. In the sub­se­quent track, 「Get Lost」, The Bigger Lights con­tin­ues the ill-advised pop trend of name­drop­ping cities. While it is com­fort­ing that the band knows their geog­ra­phy, the lyrics seem like filler and are about as shal­low as they come.<br><br>The banal­ity of the record stems directly from lead singer Topher Talley. His vocals pro­hibit The Bigger Lights from tak­ing off. In the begin­ning of the record, Talley's voice is tol­er­a­ble. However, he main­tains a sim­i­lar pitch and tone in every song. By the end of the album, one will have felt like he or she had heard the same song over and over again. In the future, Talley needs to some vari­ance in order to avoid this monot­ony. Especially in bal­lads such as 「Always」 and 「Skinny Jeans」, Talley should really show­case his abil­ity. In a genre that con­tains a glut of sim­i­lar bands, a band needs to be spe­cial to stand out, and hav­ing strong vocals is usu­ally a nice place to start.<br><br>As stated ear­lier, the pro­duc­tion is rock solid through­out The Bigger Lights and cre­ates a nice tight sound. But over­all, this self-titled effort just demon­strates that band has a good deal of matur­ing to do. While there are some pos­i­tives that can be derived from the record, the sim­plis­tic lyrics and the vocals leave a lot to be desired. The band has an abil­ity to cre­ate a nice pop groove but need the other afore­men­tioned ele­ments to solid­ify their tricks. The tools are there for the band to suc­ceed, but at the moment they have yet to cul­ti­vate it.<br><br> <br>
