<br>
<br>
The story of Houston, Texas native Sarah Elizabeth Foster s debut album, Gardening from the Ground Up Part 1, revealed itself during a two year period of meticulous and purposeful solitary songwriting sessions across various inspirational New York City neighborhoods, followed by a year of sometimes challenging, always rewarding recording with producer and multi-instrumentalist, Assaf Spector, in his Williamsburg, Brooklyn recording studio. Together they created from Sarah s songs a release so alive with raw emotion, so soulful with the use of vintage instrumentation, so varied through broad orchestrations and striped down simplicity that each song evokes an absolutely unique mood in its own surprising way.<br><br>Wake Up, opens the album with a haunting journey through a desperate conversation in a young girl s mind. While shining a light on the mental tug of war that every human experiences, it also implores you, the listener, to wake up! The second and title track, Gardening from the Ground Up, contains a metaphor for more than just a romantic relationship. Sarah is trying to rid her garden of its one remaining weed in this dramatic Bond -inspired showstopper. Next to discover, Missing You Now, is a welcome change of pace at the heart of the album. Written as a waltz, its dreamlike quality allows for relaxation and sweet reminiscence of a long-distance heartache. Then, contrary to the lush orchestrations that have been developed throughout the first three tracks, Be My Friend Always, the only track recorded live in the studio with vocals, guitar, cello, and piano, sets a mood vastly different from its predecessors. This song about friendship allows Sarah s soulful voice to be fully exposed as it jolts the senses and melts the heart. And the album concludes as the listener is carried away by Let s Go Away, a light and relaxing end to this emotional journey. Life doesn t always allow for a getaway, but this song does and so does Sarah Elizabeth Foster s debut album, Gardening from the Ground Up Part 1. Look for Gardening from the Ground Up Part 2 set for release in 2009. <br><br>1. Wake Up<br>2. Gardening from the Ground Up<br>3. Missing You Now<br>4. Be My Friend Always<br>5. Let's Go Away
