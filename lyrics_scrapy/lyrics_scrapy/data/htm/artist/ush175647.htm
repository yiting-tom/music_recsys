<dd class="hb0">Niall James Horan (born 13 September 1993) is an Irish singer and songwriter. He is best known as a member of the boy band One Direction. In 2010, Horan auditioned as a solo artist for British televised singing competition The X Factor. After being eliminated as a solo performer, Horan joined four other contestants to form One Direction. The band has released five commercially successful albums, performed on four worldwide tours, and won a number of awards.<br><br>Following the bands hiatus in 2016, Horan signed a recording deal as a solo artist with Capitol Records. Horan has released the singles 'This Town', 'Slow Hands' and 'Too Much to Ask' from his debut studio album Flicker, which was released on 20 October 2017. The album debuted at number one in Ireland and the United States, as well as charting within the top three in Australia and the UK.<br><br>Personal life<br><br>Horans parents have divorced and his mother has since remarried. He has an older brother named Greg. Horan is a supporter of Football League Championship side Derby County. Niall's a huge fan of golf; he can be seen at numerous golf events and has participated in the BMW PGA Championship Pro-Am at Wentworth. He also enjoys watching tennis and cricket occasionally; he has gone twice to the Australian Open and he's also friends with the player Novak Djokovic, and is a supporter of the Ireland cricket team.<br><br>Horan enjoyed playing a number of sports while growing up, including golf, football, and Gaelic football. In the summer of 2010, while playing football with friends, Horan injured his knee and was diagnosed with a floating kneecap. The problem recurred several times over the next couple of years, including a 2013 incident where he dislocated his knee onstage during a concert in Antwerp, Belgium. Horan came to the United States for major reconstructive surgery in January 2014, after the tour ended. After the surgery, Horan was invited to do physical therapy with Chelsea by their manager, José Mourinho. Horan went through more than seven weeks of physical therapy with the members of the team and their physical therapist at their training ground in Surrey.<br><br>Horan has involved himself in the sports world a number of times on social media, and on 8 April 2015, he caddied for professional golfer Rory McIlroy for the Par 3 contest prior to the 2015 Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. A video of Horan losing his balance during a televised interview with McIlroy circulated around the internet for several days following the tournament, causing Horan himself to tweet about the fall.<br><br>In 2016, Horan and golf player Justin Rose created the 'Horan and Rose Gala', a charity event in aid of Cancer Research UK Kids and Teens. The event was hosted by Kirsty Gallagher and Gaby Logan in London, with a dinner cooked by Jamie Oliver and a performance by Olly Murs on 29–30 May. On 12 April, Rose posted a photo of him and Horan writing songs for the event.<br><br>In April 2016, Horan was announced to be joining the Soccer Aid 2016 star line-up fundraiser for UNICEF as an assistant manager and player for the Rest of the World team. His team will consist of Claudio Ranieri, Gordon Ramsay, Michael Sheen, Nicky Byrne, and Rickie Haywood Williams, among others. Horan's team will play against fellow bandmate Louis Tomlinson, who is playing for the England team.</dd>
