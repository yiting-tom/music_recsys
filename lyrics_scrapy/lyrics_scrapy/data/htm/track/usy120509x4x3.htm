I got some skeletons in my closet<br>And I don't know if no one knows it<br>So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it<br>I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73<br>Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD<br>I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months<br>My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch<br>Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye<br>No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die<br>I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side<br>Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try<br>To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake<br>I maybe made some mistakes<br>But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today<br>What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb<br>But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun<br>Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both<br>It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 'The Eminem Show'<br>Oh (eyyy)<br>I've been travellin' on this road too long (too long)<br>Just tryna find my way back home (back home)<br>The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone<br>And oh (eyyy)<br>I've been travellin' on this road too long (too long)<br>Just tryna find my way back home (back home)<br>The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone<br>Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition<br>Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing<br>But put yourself in my position; just try to envision<br>Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing<br>Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome<br>My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't<br>'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach<br>Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?<br>So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?<br>But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely<br>And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony<br>And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful<br>But you'll never see her - she won't even be at your funeral!<br>See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong<br>Bitch do your song - keep telling yourself that you was a mom!<br>But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get<br>You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit<br>Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?<br>Well guess what, I am dead - dead to you as can be!<br>Oh (eyyy)<br>I've been travellin' on this road too long (too long)<br>Just tryna find my way back home (back home)<br>The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone<br>And oh (eyyy)<br>I've been travellin' on this road too long (too long)<br>Just tryna find my way back home (back home)<br>The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone<br>I turn my head to the East<br>I don't see nobody by my side<br>I turn my head to the West<br>Still nobody in sight<br>So I turn my head to the North<br>Swallow that pill that they call pride<br>That old me is dead and gone<br>But that new me will be alright<br>I turn my head to the East<br>I don't see nobody by my side<br>I turn my head to the West<br>Still nobody in sight<br>So I turn my head to the North<br>Swallow that pill that they call pride<br>That old me is dead and gone<br>But that new me will be alright<br>Oh (eyyy)<br>I've been travellin' on this road too long (too long)<br>Just tryna find my way back home (back home)<br>The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone<br>And oh (eyyy)<br>I've been travellin' on this road too long (too long)<br>Just tryna find my way back home (back home)<br>The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone<br><br>
