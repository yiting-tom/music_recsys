<dd class="hb0">Cannibal Corpse is an American death metal band from Buffalo, New York. Formed in December 1988, the band has released fourteen studio albums, two box sets, four video albums, and two live albums. The band has had little radio or television exposure throughout its career, although a cult following began to build after the release of the 1991 album Butchered at Birth and 1992 album Tomb of the Mutilated. As of 2015, they achieved worldwide sales of two million units for combined sales of all their albums, making them the top-selling death metal band of all time.<br><br>Bassist Alex Webster came up with the name Cannibal Corpse. They have had several lineup changes since their inception, with bassist Alex Webster and drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz as the only constant members. The members of Cannibal Corpse were originally inspired by thrash metal bands like Slayer and Kreator and other death metal bands such as Morbid Angel and Death. The band's album art (most often by Vincent Locke) and lyrics, drawing heavily on horror fiction and horror films, are highly controversial. At different times, several countries, such as Germany and Russia, have banned Cannibal Corpse from performing within their borders, or have banned the sale and display of original Cannibal Corpse album covers.<br><br><br>History<br><br>Cannibal Corpse was established in 1988 by members from earlier Buffalo-area death metal bands Beyond Death (Webster, Owen), Leviathan (Barnes), and Tirant Sin (Barnes, Rusay, Mazurkiewicz). The band played its first show at Buffalo's River Rock Cafe in March 1989, shortly after recording a five-song demo tape, Cannibal Corpse. Within a year of the first gig, the band was signed to Metal Blade Records, apparently after the label had heard their demo that was sent in by the manager of the record store at which Chris Barnes was working. Their full-length debut album, Eaten Back to Life, was released in August 1990.<br><br>The band has had many line-up changes over the years. In 1993, founding member and guitarist Bob Rusay was dismissed from the group (after which he became a golf instructor) and was ultimately replaced by Malevolent Creation guitarist Rob Barrett. In 1995, during recording sessions for a new album, singer Chris Barnes was dismissed because of personal differences with the rest of the band and was replaced by Monstrosity singer George 'Corpsegrinder' Fisher. Barnes went on to perform with the band Six Feet Under and, later, Torture Killer.<br><br>In 1997, Barrett, who had originally replaced Rusay on guitar, left Cannibal Corpse to rejoin his previous bands Malevolent Creation and Solstice. After Barrett left, he was replaced by guitarist Pat O'Brien, who first appeared on Cannibal Corpse's 1998 release Gallery of Suicide. Founding member and guitarist Jack Owen left Cannibal Corpse in 2004 to spend more time on his second band, Adrift. He joined Deicide in late 2004. Jeremy Turner of Origin briefly replaced him as second guitarist on 2004's Tour of The Wretched Spawn. Barrett rejoined the band in 2005 and was first featured on the album Kill, released in March 2006.<br><br>Writing for the next album began in November 2007, as indicated in an interview with bassist Alex Webster. Evisceration Plague, Cannibal Corpse's eleventh studio album was released February 3, 2009, to a highly positive response from fans. They also released a live DVD in 2011 entitled Global Evisceration. Cannibal Corpse released its twelfth studio album, Torture, in March 2012.<br><br>In February 2014, Cannibal Corpse announced that they had begun recording their thirteenth album, A Skeletal Domain, which was released on September 16. 'Sadistic Embodiment' was released as a single in July, and all of the names of the songs on the forthcoming album were announced the same day. The same month, Metal Blade announced the publication of the band's authorized biography Bible Of Butchery, written by the British author Joel McIver.<br><br>In an August 2016 interview, drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz stated that Cannibal Corpse would likely begin recording a new album in 2017. In September 2017, the band announced their fourteenth studio album, Red Before Black, which was released on November 3.<br><br>Band members<br><br>Current members<br><br>    Alex Webster – bass (1988–present)<br>    Paul Mazurkiewicz – drums (1988–present)<br>    Rob Barrett – guitar (1993–1997, 2005–present)<br>    George 'Corpsegrinder' Fisher – lead vocals (1995–present)<br>    Pat O'Brien – guitar (1997–present)<br><br>Former members<br><br>    Jack Owen – rhythm guitar (1988–2004)<br>    Chris Barnes – lead vocals (1988–1995)<br>    Bob Rusay – lead guitar (1988–1993)<br><br>Live musicians<br><br>    Jeremy Turner – rhythm guitar (2004–2005)<br><br><br>Discography<br><br>    Eaten Back to Life (1990)<br>    Butchered at Birth (1991)<br>    Tomb of the Mutilated (1992)<br>    The Bleeding (1994)<br>    Vile (1996)<br>    Gallery of Suicide (1998)<br>    Bloodthirst (1999)<br>    Gore Obsessed (2002)<br>    The Wretched Spawn (2004)<br>    Kill (2006)<br>    Evisceration Plague (2009)<br>    Torture (2012)<br>    A Skeletal Domain (2014)<br>    Red Before Black (2017)</dd>
