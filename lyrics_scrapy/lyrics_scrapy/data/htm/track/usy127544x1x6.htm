<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> Too Good To Be True</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>Well I come from a long line of skeptics and I've always thought<br>that if something seemed too good to be true, then it was probably too<br>good to be true. So one day I was walking down the sidewalk, minding my<br>own business, having a good old time when I came upon a bag and I<br>thought if that bag was full of money it would be too good to be true.<br><br>So I sat down on the bench and I opened up the bag and when I looked<br>inside, sure enough it was full of money. How much money? I'll tell<br>you, a lot of money. And I thought, man what should I do? This seems<br>too good to be true. Yeah, it's just too good to be true.<br><br>So I hid behind the bench and I waited to see if anyone would come<br>looking for the big bag of money. And sure enough, these two scruffy<br>guys came by and one said to the other, 'I left the bag right here and<br>if someone found it and gave it back to me I was going to give them a<br>big reward, like it was a test to see how honest they could be.' I<br>peeked at them and I thought no, you can't fool me. That sounds a<br>little too good to be true.<br><br>So I took the money home and I put it in my room, turned on the TV<br>and checked out the news, and they said that sure enough there had been<br>a bank robbery that very afternoon, but nobody should worry because the<br>bad guys took only funny money so nothing was really missing. And I<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>thought, 'That doesn't sound right. That sounds too good to be true.'<br><br>So I went up to my room and opened up the bag and much to my<br>surprise I found out it was funny money. The money started talking and<br>telling me jokes. It said, 'What's green and has wheels?' I said, 'I<br>don't know'. And it said, 'Cash...I was lying about the wheels.' Well,<br>I quickly shut the bag and thought, man, I know exactly what to do.<br>Hey, 'cause this is just too good to be true.<br><br>So I took it to the TV station and I got a slot on a late night talk<br>show. When I opened up the bag, the funny money told a few jokes and<br>everybody laughed and they gave me a bunch of cash and I bought a big<br>car and a bunch of other stuff and I know what you're thinking. You're<br>thinking I'm making this up because… because it sounds too good to be<br>true. And you know what? I'd have to agree with you. Yeah now, it might<br>be too good to be true. Yeah it's just too good to be true.<br><br>Yeah you just remember when somebody starts telling you something<br>that sounds too good to be true, odds are pretty good it's too good to<br>be true. If it's too good to be true, then it's probably too good to be<br>true.<br><br>
