<br>
<br>
   It s a rare occurrence that a band is able to seemingly reinvent a genre overnight, let alone accomplish such a task on a debut. Leave it to I See Stars to set the bar just a bit higher. This six-piece electronic/screamo hybrid has been the object of a massive amount of hype and with good reason Vocalist Devin Oliver leads the charge with a vocal prowess much akin to that of current Saosin front-man Cove Reber, and he is a mere 16 years old! Devin s sheer talent, be it his soon-to-be trademark shrills, or his ability to craft wholesome, intelligent lyrics, along with support of the remaining members, who s ages also average around 16, is sure to put similar bands that have been at it for many years to shame <br><br>Just three notes into 3D, Devin s vocals light the air and I See Stars blows the doors open with Project Wakeup , an extremely guitar driven song laced with a mesmerizing synth backing. The track displays the versatility of Devin s voice with the various transitions from a peaceful swoon to a violent, yet controlled, scream. One thing immediately noticed throughout the album is how masterfully the keys blend in, as similar bands have the tendency to abuse it s use, while on 3D, every key is in balance and makes sense. The title track from the album, 3D, will likely be the record s first single, and really explores the vocal skill of the 16-year-old front man. Significantly more upbeat than the other songs alongside a real danceable melody, it is perhaps the most structurally sound song on the album. The rest of 3D follows suit, with each track as infectious and captivating as the last, playing out like an album of an already well established and recognized band, rather than a group of teenagers <br><br>It s clear that I See Stars has a long and bright future ahead of them Having already shared the stage with the likes of scene heavyweight s A Skylit Drive and Dance Gavin Dance, this youthful band is prepped and ready to take the world by storm. The album is being received strongly thus far throughout the critical world, and most of it s acclaim can be attributed to the extremely strong vocals on the album. Though they are still young, one can only hope with a such an awe-inspiring debut, they will blossom into something truly amazing. 3D is merely step one of I See Stars plot to take over the world! Believe the hype, and while you re at it, chalk one for Sumerian. The revolution is now <br>
