<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
Recording in his recently adopted hometown of New York, producing himself for the first time, and playing with a group of extremely talented musicians he has dubbed The Triple Crown; Shooter is more relaxed and confident on this album than ever before. Featuring renowned jazz pianist Erik Deutsch, guitarist Chris Masterson, drummer Tony Leone, bassist Jeff Hill, pedal steel player John Graboff, and rising roots music star Eleanor Whitmore, who contributes harmony vocals as well as playing mandolin and fiddle, the Triple Crown brings to mind such ensembles as Merle Haggard's Strangers, Bob Wills' Texas Playboys, and Buck Owens' Buckaroos, becoming an integral part of the music and adding their unique stamp to each and every note. It is his rebel DNA accompanied with his mature outlook and emotional strength of a father and a family man, which makes him one of the most exciting artists of his era.<br><br>This album was really the first time that I took the creative process entirely in my own hands. I had formed a new band, The Triple Crown, after reuniting with an old friend Erik Deutsch, who plays keys in the band, and went into the studio, producing the album myself. We spent a month in the Magic Shop in Soho and came out with what I think is my most country record to date. I'm really proud of this record and the songs on it, as this was the first time that I wrote the entire record on an acoustic, made demos, and treated the songs as a blue print for The Triple Crown to interpret. says Jennings<br><br>The first single from the album The Deed and The Dollar was released on iTunes on December 20th, 2011 and is considered by Shooter to be the perfect love song. Shooter relies heavily on his own experiences throughout the album and as a result many of the songs are very autobiographical in nature, whether he's addressing critics on The Family Tree; paying tribute to his roots on the hard-rocking Southern Family Anthem; (We may be trash, but we're a family, he sings), or diving into deeply personal territory with heartfelt ballads like Daddy's Hands, a song which was inspired by an illness in his family last year. <br><br>1.
