<dd class="hb0">Blake Tollison Shelton (born June 18, 1976) is an American singer-songwriter, actor, and television personality. In 2001, he made his debut with the single 'Austin'. The lead-off single from his self-titled debut album, 'Austin' spent five weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The now Platinum-certified debut album also produced two more top 20 entries ('All Over Me' and 'Ol' Red'). Although the album was released on Giant Records Nashville, he was transferred to Warner Bros. Records Nashville after Giant closed in late 2001.<br><br>His second and third albums, 2003's The Dreamer and 2004's Blake Shelton's Barn &amp; Grill, are gold and platinum, respectively. His fourth album, Pure BS (2007), was re-issued in 2008 with a cover of Michael Bublé's pop hit 'Home' as one of the bonus tracks. His fifth album, Startin' Fires was released in November 2008. It was followed by the extended plays Hillbilly Bone and All About Tonight in 2010, and the albums Red River Blue in 2011, Based on a True Story... in 2013, Bringing Back the Sunshine in 2014, and If I'm Honest in 2016. Overall, in the country charts Blake Shelton has charted 33 singles, including 24 number ones, 17 of which were consecutive. The 11th No. 1 ('Doin' What She Likes') broke 'the record for the most consecutive No. 1 singles in the Country Airplay chart's 24-year history'. He is an eight-time Grammy Award nominee.<br><br>Shelton is also known for his role as a judge on the televised singing competitions Nashville Star, Clash of the Choirs, and The Voice. He has been on The Voice since its inception, and in five of twelve seasons (2–4, 7, 11), a member of his team has won. From 2011 to 2015, Shelton was married to singer Miranda Lambert.<br><br><br>Shelton has been the recipient of nine Country Music Association Awards, five Academy of Country Music Awards, one CMT Artist of the Year award, and seven CMT Music Awards. He has also received eight American Country Awards, three People's Choice Awards, two American Music Awards, one Billboard Music Award, and one iHeartRadio Music Awards, among others. Shelton has won 24 BMI awards and 24 ASCAP awards. He was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in 2010, for his many accomplishments in country music, and into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 2014, attaining the highest honor one can receive from the state. In April 2013, Shelton was awarded the prestigious Gene Weed Special Achievement Award from the Academy of Country Music for his unprecedented, unique and outstanding individual achievement in country music and television. For his work on The Voice as a television personality, Shelton received the NATPE Reality Breakthrough Award for Best Reality Personality in 2017. Shelton has garnered eight Grammy nominations throughout his career, including nominations for Best Country Album, Best Country Solo Performance, and Best Music Film.<br><br>As one of the most successful country artists today, Shelton has sold over 10 million records worldwide, and as of 2017, has sold in excess of 30 million singles, while having generated a total of 1.7 billion streams worldwide. Shelton has also amassed a tremendous commercial impact on the country music industry. His debut single 'Austin', off his 2001 Platinum-selling self-titled album, tied the record set by Billy Ray Cyrus in 1992, staying atop the country charts for five weeks, and setting the mark for an artist's debut single in the Broadcast Data Systems era. The success of 'Austin' also led Shelton to claim the #1 position on both Billboard's Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart and Top Country Singles Sales chart, making him the first debut male country artist to own the top spot on both charts simultaneously. Later, in 2010, Shelton's first single, 'Honey Bee', from his sixth studio album Red River Blue, set a new record for the most first-week downloads by a male country singer. As a result of the downloads, the song debuted at number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated for the week ending April 23, 2011. This entry made Shelton the highest-debuting male country artist on the Hot 100 since Garth Brooks (recording as Chris Gaines) debuted at number five in September 1999. As a result of the song's massive commercial success, Shelton also claimed the record for the fastest rising single ever to sell over 500,000 digital copies by a male country soloist. In 2013, Shelton's eighth album, Based on a True Story..., spawned the hit 'Doin' What She Likes', which broke the record previously set by Brad Paisley in 2009 for the most consecutive #1 singles in the Country Airplay chart's 24-year history, since it was first tracked by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems in January 1990. In 2016, 'Came Here to Forget', the lead-off single from Shelton's tenth studio album If I'm Honest, extended this streak into a record-breaking 17 consecutive number one singles, leading him to surpass Earl Thomas Conley's record of 16 consecutive number one singles. As of 2017, Shelton remains one of only five country artists to have achieved #1 status on the Billboard Artist 100 chart, having charted all 156 weeks the chart has existed. The CMA Awards also recognizes Shelton, in addition to George Strait and Vince Gill, as the record holders for the most Male Vocalist of the Year wins, as all three have each garnered 5 victories. On January 18, 2017, Shelton made People's Choice Awards history by becoming the first country artist to ever win the all-genre category of Favorite Album over competitors Beyoncé, Drake, Rihanna and Ariana Grande. During the ceremony, Shelton also took home the trophy for Favorite Male Country Artist, marking his second consecutive win in the category. On November 6, 2017, Shelton made Country Aircheck history when he became the first artist in the history of the chart to chart six songs simultaneously, from his eleventh studio album Texoma Shore. On November 14, 2017, Shelton made People Magazine history by becoming the first country artist ever the grace the magazine's Sexiest Man Alive cover issue, and is only the second musician, apart from fellow The Voice coach Adam Levine, to receive the coveted honor. In 2016, Billboard released their list of 'Greatest of All Time Country Artists' and recognized Shelton on the chart, ranking him at #50. Shelton also charted on Billboard's list of 'Greatest of All Time Country Albums' and 'Greatest of All Time Country Songs' with Based on a True Story... taking the position of #51 on the chart and 'God Gave Me You' ranking at #80 on the chart, respectively.<br><br>Discography<br><br>    Blake Shelton (2001)<br>    The Dreamer (2003)<br>    Blake Shelton's Barn &amp; Grill (2004)<br>    Pure BS (2007)<br>    Startin' Fires (2008)<br>    Red River Blue (2011)<br>    Cheers, It's Christmas (2012)<br>    Based on a True Story...
