<br>
<br>
In Feb. '06 the band released `We're Already Gone' in the US and Canada. They did their first headline tour in March to support the release. May of the gigs sold out the whole Canadian tour did and the band was asked to perform an encore gig at the Belly Up in Aspen the week after they played there. TBG have completed seven tours of the United States and Canada. They've toured with Mason, Jennings, Slightly Stoopid and Fishbone, twice with Pepper, and their music inspired Dave Chappelle to join them on stage. TBG have played Michael Franti's Peace Festival. Where we grew up, anybody that played in a band, played heavy music I wanted to pick a name that was the exact opposite of all that macho posturing and the associated tough-guy band names. A beautiful girl was just about the sweetest most appropriate opposite I could think of, front man Mat McHugh explains the meaning behind the moniker of his Australian-based band, The Beautiful Girls. Influenced by everything from jazz to reggae to rock to Johnny Cash, the band has formed its own unique sound that anyone can enjoy and identify with. After releasing their first cd in 2002, the band has progressed to their newest endeavor entitled, Ziggurats due out in the US on September 18th, 2007. Touring internationally with such acts as Slightly Stoopid, Mason Jennings, and Pepper, this dynamic Australian trio has truly set the foundation for a worldwide fan base that is sure to expand exponentially. <br><br>1.
