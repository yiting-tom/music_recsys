<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
THICK AS BLOOD is a very proud hardcore band from Miami, FL. Formed in '04, they started out as a seven man team but recently trimmed down their roster to five, bringing out a more focused sound. They released their debut album Moment Of Truth; in '07, toured the states numerous times including Canada sharing stages with the likes of Madball, Terror, Bleeding Through and much more.<br><br>Embrace is the much anticipated follow-up to their debut Moment Of Truth which finds THICK AS BLOOD evolving into a much heavier, faster and more brutally honest band. The album was recorded, mixed and mastered at the infamous Machine Shop (Lamb Of God, Every Time I Die) in Weehawken, NJ. Drums were recorded at Nuthouse Studios, Hoboken, NJ. The track Decimator musically highlights their thrash/heavy metal influences while at the same time lyrically touching on their feelings toward deceivers. Misery Loves Company incorporates a whole new melodic side of THICK AS BLOOD while still bringing forth a new level of intensity and also lyrically dealing with envy and how pathetic it can make someone. Embrace also includes a special surprise that showcases another musical side of THICK AS BLOOD but still keepin' it street. They plan to tour both the U.S. and beyond extensively to support Embrace.<br><br>There is also a video The Making Of Embrace which follows them all the way from the depths of Viper City to the outskirts of New Jersey's gold coast, where the band recorded Embrace. Featuring behind-the-scenes interviews and hilarious studio footage, watch as the band reap the benefits of seemingly endless caffeine surges, clogged toilets and shout out opportunities. Somewhere between all the antics, they even made a record. Shot and edited by Scott Shanley at Machine Shop Productions.<br><br>THICK AS BLOOD plan to tour both the U.S. and beyond extensively to support Embrace.
