ask you a question, you like to fuck?<br>Oh, you don't want me to talk to you like that<br>Will you like to make love?<br><br>I saw you walking down the street, and I had to stop<br>Turn up the radio and drop the top<br>I see you look so good, and your so fine<br>Young tender, would you be mine<br>I get you in my car, drive you to my house<br>'Cuz I'm a Mack, I cold turn you out<br>I won't ask, and I sure won't beg<br>Reach right over and rub your leg<br><br>I let my hand slide between your Miniskirt<br>Slip a finger in your panties, straight go to work<br>What time is it, don't watch the clock<br>Lay back baby doll and I'll rock the cock<br>Funky fresh I am, and I always can, freak nasty<br>I'm the man<br>I take you out to the finest resturant<br>Buy you any damn thing that you want<br><br>You want flowers, I'll buy your ass a rose<br>But later on you're coming off with them panyhose<br>You want gold, girl what's next<br>It's me and you, doing the sex<br>So now you know I'm just a freak<br>Give it up baby, I can't wait two weeks<br>I want it all, don't say I won't<br>Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't<br><br>Nigga please, you provoke no feeling<br>You must of forgot, the girls of whom you're dealing<br>We haven't the urge, to get busy<br>Like those Dizzy Lizzys, who used to dance for you, your through<br>I can't put it more blunt, your vocab is restricted<br>You're addicted, to the words you inflicted<br>Time after time, line after line<br>Talking bout the bitches that are on your mind<br><br>Do they call you Short because of your height or your weight?<br>Diss me boy, I'll hang your balls from a cliff<br>Wrapped around a slinky, your a dinky<br>It's an easy task, to the corner cause the curb didn't want your ass<br>Your name is yuck mouth, you don't brush<br>Gotta cover your mouth like this<br>They call you yuck mouth<br>You refuse to brush, no sweetheart you can keep that kiss<br><br>Your a freak with no tale<br>You have no ass, class, you can't pass, your simply trash<br>Your a typical nigga, the kind you don't take home<br>This isn't tights and Barbie from the danger zone<br>Like a short dogg that carries fleas<br>You make my ass itch, twitch, don't you wish you could scratch it<br>And grab it like you want it<br>The name fits cause your all up on it<br><br>Get mad if you want, I won't front<br>When it's time to hump, won't be no punk<br>Roll your ass over and tap the butt<br>Too short baby all in them guts<br>I'm not your ABC, from the alphabet<br>Every letter I'll write'll get your pussy wet<br>It's just a freaky note, from me to you<br>At the bottom I signed it Playboy 2<br><br>I'm a player, bitch, I thought you knew<br>Like every other nigga in my crew<br>I bump hoes, now it's your turn<br>Tell me young tender when will you learn<br>I cold Mack like pimps you know<br>Won't sell you dope or sell you blow<br>Just your average everyday straight bump up bitch<br>My gold rings come from Spitz<br><br>Look baby, you know what I want<br>Your acting like it's that time of the month<br>Are you bleeding, can't think about sex<br>Irritated by your Kotex<br>We don't need to kiss, we don't have to fuck<br>I'll pull out my dick bitch, you can suck<br>Now here, don't say I won't<br>Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't<br><br>Punk I'm not a tease, I'm not a skeezer<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>And most definately, not a dick pleaser<br>You dreaming, and scheaming, and fiending for my lust<br>You don't have enough, for you I feel disgust<br>Wait, small things I hate<br>For goodness sakes, if I wanted someone small I would masturbate<br>I'm not talking 'bout your height, weight, or what you dream<br>When I say too short, you know what I mean<br><br>You see, I need a man, not a boy to approach me<br>Your lame game, really insults me<br>Your name is Too Short, or shall I say too skinny<br>If size were money honey, you wouldn't have a penny<br>Little boy, your not a player<br>I'm your savior<br>To try to get at me shows your bodacious behavior<br>I have to sit on my feet to come down to your level<br><br>Your mother should have hung you, from her umbilical cord<br>If she would have known your mission<br>Okay little boy, here's a proposition<br>You wanna bit of danger, step you to my zone<br>You call yourself a dogg, thatz how I'll send you home<br>With your tail between your legs, screeching and whining<br>Jealous of you got some, nigga please your lying<br>'Cause I fight the feeling, that would have to be one<br>And mathmatically, me plus you equals none<br><br>I am the rapper that they call 4 Tay<br>I'm gon tell you like my homie short dogg would say<br>Hoes in the world, trying to play it sweet<br>Knowing damn well that they wanna freak<br>Some do this for maybe a week<br>And then it's cool to get up under the sheets<br>Trying to work that thang, but she said no<br>That's about as far as it's going to go<br>So I toss and turn, to make it loose<br><br>Finally she feels the act right juice<br>Some of you hoes say, oh that's nasty<br>Back of your coat say sweet and sassy<br>24 deep, that's how you sleep<br>Undercover freak every day of the week<br>You see some of you freaks just need to quit it<br>Playing that role like you ain't with it<br>The rest of you freaks just won't admit it<br>Especially when you know just who can get it<br><br>Ain't body tripping 'cuz I know I'm right<br>You could be black or you could be white<br>For a black girl it really don't take too long<br>But a white girl's always tryin to turn ya on<br>With a little squeze, but it's just a tease<br>Give her some time, she'll be on her knees<br>Then I'll pick her up, so I can work the butt<br>Baby, I just wanna try to bust a nut<br>But don't get me wrong, 'cause you started it all<br><br>Coming to my house in a Camisole<br>But when it's time for me to shove<br>Then you front on all that love<br>First you said that I deserve it<br>Now you fight, don't want to serve it<br>Gave it some time, so make up your mind<br>Don't fight the feeling, it's time to unwind<br>You was talking 'bout you gunna give my some<br>But I'm rappin 4 tay it don't make me numb<br><br>Yeah man, the little hoes got ill<br>So now it's time to get way to real<br>I know they never have some real dick<br>They need to quit talking that childish shit<br>You wanna rank hoe<br>Go get your bank hoe<br>My little dick'll have you screaming though<br>Because when it comes to sex, you don't know what's up<br>Your still playing that finger fuck<br><br>See I'm a grown man<br>I bust some young cock out<br>I like big butts, not big mouths<br>I know some little girls'll break you down in bed<br>Pull your drawers down, give you some head<br>But little girl, you wanna have some fun<br>You better go to magic mountain 'cuz your way too young<br>So at this point, I can't really say shit<br>Ain't dropping no lines, I'll just call you a bitch<br>Beyotch!<br><br>
