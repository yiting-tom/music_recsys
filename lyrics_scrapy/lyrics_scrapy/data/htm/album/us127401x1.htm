<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
Trevor Tanner ( formerly of The Bolshoi ), working closely with Emperor Penguin Recordings' ( EPR ) Creative Director, David Paul Wyatt Perko, has been slowly releasing solo recordings. Tanner's first release on Emperor Penguin Recordings was an elaborate 3-CD boxed-set ( the three volumes are also available individually ) entitled: Bullish, Bellyache &amp; Belch, which was released in 2004. The set consists of 41 songs in total, which were hand-picked by Perko out of a pool of well over a hundred Tanner works-in-progress. With this fourth release on Emperor Penguin Recordings, Tanner has, without doubt, finally surpassed his previous era of recognition and notoriety as former frontman of the late '80s The Bolshoi and solidified himself - like a sun-dried starfish - as one of today's most astonishing musical artists. He is at once musically nostalgic and pioneering - a celebrated father of Brit-Pop who inadvertently is teaching the new kids new tricks.<br><br>Eaten By The Sea was a more elaborate endeavor for Tanner as he chose to create 100% of the content solely on his own ( no other musicians contributed ). Aside from allowing Tanner to tap into a more abundant pool of his brilliant talents, going dead-on solo also made it possible for Tanner to experiment in a more informal and relaxed manner, not needing to appease any other individuals involved. So, although the creation of this release took Tanner four years of diving deep within himself to uncover new glittery treasure, the colossal voyage was truly a necessity and now offers fans something 'Melodic &amp; Masterful' - Chester Von Magneto - a sonically spectacular trip through every corner of Tanner's prodigious mind.<br><br>The mechanics for Eaten By The Sea were not about coming up with a solid one-hook wonder and then paraphrasing the discovery and format over and over again to bleed an album dry of any redeeming value, essentially making all tracks sound rigorously and boringly consistent, which major record labels always tend to stubbornly push for - but rather, the vision was more about carving out new sounds, technics, melodies, hooks and styles at each new fathom within the vast ocean of this breathtaking material.<br><br>Currently, in between tour dates with Celtic Rock ensemble Rathkeltair, Tanner is in various studios and dark corners working up the next schematics of skeletons and sketches that will eventually become his fifth EPR solo release. Although no official release date has been announced ( and the on-goings of this fifth project are shrouded in mystery ) it has been disclosed that a singing-saw, as well as a theremin, are involved.<br><br>For now... walk the plank, jump aboard Tanner's latest majestic vessel sailing through wondrous, eclectic waters and set your anchor in the sui generis albeit mischievous, dark blue abyss of Eaten By The Sea. Love is the scourge.
