Aside from her solo career, Syd was a member of the Los Angeles alternative hip hop collective Odd Future and is the lead vocalist for the soul band The Internet. She is the older sister of Odd Future member Travis 'Taco' Bennett. She is currently signed to Columbia Records.<br><br>Background<br><br>Growing up in a musical family influenced Bennett's interest in music. Her mother once aspired to be a DJ and her uncle is a reggae producer from Jamaica. As she explained, 'I began wishing I could take credit for some of my favorite songs. That was when I started to make my own – I only began singing on my own songs when I really started writing.' When Bennett was 14, she built a small music studio in her home and worked on sound engineering before getting into production.<br><br>For the first half of her high school years, Syd attended Palisades Charter High School. Bennett felt left out and had few friends at Palisades and moved to the Hamilton Music Academy, which she considered a more open-minded school.<br>Musical career<br><br>Syd began making music while she was still living with her parents. Syd's stage name was given to her by her big brother, Ty, as a kid. After growing out of it, she reclaimed the name when she joined Odd Future. Most of the group's original songs were recorded in Syd's house, also known as 'The Trap'.<br><br>On February 27, 2011, Syd self-released her debut instrumental extended play, Raunchboots.<br><br>On March 11, 2016, Syd officially announced her departure from Odd Future.<br><br>On January 13, 2017, Syd's debut solo single 'All About Me' was released. It was produced by The Internet cohort Steve Lacy. On January 24, 2017, her second solo single 'Body' was released in anticipation for her album in collaboration with Columbia Records, Fin which was released on February 3, 2017.<br><br>On May 18, 2017, Syd starred together with Korean R&amp;B artist Dean in his music video for their collaboration 'love'.<br><br>On September 7, 2017, Syd released 'Almost Never Home' which is a three track EP. 'Almost Never Home' is the follow-up to her debut solo album Fin</dd>
