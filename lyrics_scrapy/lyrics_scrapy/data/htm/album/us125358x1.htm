<br>
It was no accident that the Scene was formed in suburban Washington D.C. The city had already established itself as a vibrant bluegrass community with recently transplanted Southerners intermingling with an open minded, sophisticated group of fans that included college students, doctors, lawyers and politicos. There were several excellent radio stations playing bluegrass music as well as clubs and music parks stretching from Baltimore to Northern Virginia that welcomed bluegrass acts. In short, the infrastructure was in place for people in and around the Beltway to not only to support the Scene's weekly gigs at the legendary Red Fox Inn in Bethesda, Maryland, but to also help trigger a national buzz about the group's knack for offering something special and unique.<br><br>From the start, the band became known for its smooth, sophisticated renditions of songs from non-rural sources; yet, at the same time, it earned the respect of traditionalists by performing material of the genre's forefathers: Bill Monroe, Flatt &amp; Scruggs and the Stanley Brothers. Blessed with two of the best and most recognizable singers in bluegrass (John Duffey and John Starling) the band also featured banjo player Ben Eldridge, bassist Tom Gray and Mike Auldridge, whose tasteful and innovative Dobro style helped lay the blueprint for contemporary bluegrass as we know it today. <br><br>1.
