<dt id="fsZx2" class="fsZx2"> Imagine It</dt><dd id="fsZx3" class="fsZx3"><br>Can you imagine it?<br>Hangin there bleedin to death<br>Wheezin for breath Your stomach hurts cause You got beat in the chest!<br>You're all bloody from Your feet to Your head!<br>From the look of things You think You'd be dead!<br>But You not cause You gotta finish the work<br>Every second's like a minute every minute it hurts<br>You're screamin in pain 'Oh God!' Screamin His name!<br>'Why have You forsaken Me? This is the reason I came!'<br>You cryin inside but you can't cry from Your eyes<br>Cause Your face is so swollen it's drivin You blind<br>Your back aches! Cause pressure is applied to Your spine<br>When You press up on Your feet cause You tryin to climb<br>Up the cross just to get a gasp of air<br>And meanwhile everybody laughs and cheers<br>It's only been ten minutes but it feels like half a year<br>The Roman soldiers grab and tear at your clothes<br>Leavin Your private exposed humiliated is how You died for the Throne!<br>And they witness at the sight of Your death<br>And they watch You as You fightin for breath!<br>Every insult feels like a knife thru Your chest<br>And blood comes down Your neck from the spikes in Your head<br>The crown of thorns! Somebody sound the horn!<br>Cause the curtain from the temple yo they found it torn!<br>That means SALVATION'S FREE!<br>He paid the fee I once was blind but now He made me see<br>I went from pee-wee to playin in the major leagues<br>The temple was destroyed in 1 day but raised in 3<br><br>Can you imagine it?<br>Gettin hit in the jaw with people standin over You<br>Yellin 'PICK UP THE CROSS!'<br>They take a stick and strike You over the head<br>Over and over and over again<br>They beat You down they smile when they see You frown<br>They spit in Your face and laugh as You bleed in the ground<br>You try to get up but You can barely walk<br>So they force another man to carry the cross!<br>You've been condemned<br>All You did is give to men You lived for them<br>But they would rather live for sin<br>You never fought back but You get whipped again!<br>So hard that it rips Your skin<br>Betrayed by the kiss of a friend<br>Slain by the fists of men!<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>On a scale from 1 to 5 the pain gets a 10<br>But You haven't even felt the half!<br>Felt the wrath until You feel the cross rub up against Your back<br>Thoughts of life and death are runnin through Your mind<br>The splinters from the wood are runnin through Your spine<br>This is worse than any story in the New York Times<br>They found You guilty and never even knew Your crime!<br>Every woman and man is there they stand and stare<br>And watch as You hang like a chandelier<br>Can You bear the nails in both Your legs?<br>Both Your arms? Even though You know they're wrong?<br>Can you imagine it? That's why I wrote this song<br>You can laugh but it's you that the joke is on!<br><br>They drove nails through His hands<br>You could see the blood squirt<br>Now i know what they mean when they say that love hurts<br>Imagine torture! Only this is much worse!<br>Just the thought of it makes me wanna hit the ground and hug dirt!<br>Why'd He do it for me? I wouldn't have done it for Him<br>I'm not a righteous man matter of fact I'm nothing but sin!<br>I'm not clean I got dirt stuck to my skin<br>And it's like I'm proud of it so I cuss and I grin<br>I said 'I HATE YOU!' and He told me that He loved me<br>I stabbed Him in His back and He turned around and hugged me<br>They beat Him when instead they should have mugged me!<br>Shoulda left me on the cross and watch the blood leak<br>My tongue speaks all I do is curse and lie<br>That's why I deserve to die Go to Hell!<br>Man I should be the first to fry!<br>But they gave Him the blame like He was worse than I<br>Worse than he! Worse than she! Straight up cold blooded murder in the first degree<br>You aint gotta go to church to believe!<br>Only cause you heard it from me!<br>Just close your eyes and think of the murderous scene!<br><br>Could you walk in His shoes?<br>Drink from His cup?<br>He opened up His arms like 'I love you this much!'<br>Could you do what He did?<br>Die so that we live?<br>If you could then your name is Jesus<br><br>
