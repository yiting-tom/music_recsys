They have toured the country, gone through numerous lineup changes, are managed by the esteemed Ozone Management firm, booked by Paradigm Booking Agency, have signed a publishing deal with Sony/ATV, and are now signed to Columbia Records.<br><br>In 2006, Matt Villani left the Pop Punk group, Valet Parking to form a new project, called Stereo Skyline. He played piano, synth, and was the lead vocalist and had Kevin Bard on guitars and vocals, Jay Marotta on guitar, Tom Angenbroich on bass, and Anthony Purpura on drums. The band recorded their debut EP, entitled 「Worst Case Scenario in 2006 with producer Nick Zinnanti. Following their EP, the band began playing shows around the island. In 2007, they went through a major lineup change. Kevin Bard became the lead singer, Matt Villani moved to guitar and piano, Jay Marotta continued on guitar, Tom Angenbroich continued on bass, Anthony Purpura was moved to synthesizer, and Rob Michelson was added on drums.<br><br>The band continued playing shows, and won a competition to play the 2007 Bamboozle Festival. Afterwards, the band obtained a new manager, resulting in the departure of their bassist Tom Angenbroich, who quit due to disagreements in the new direction, and shortly after kicked out their synth player, Anthony Purpura.
