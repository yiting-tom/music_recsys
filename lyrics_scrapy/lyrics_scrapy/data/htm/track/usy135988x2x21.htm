'<br>Even dummies know that!'<br>My grandma was not the gushy kind, never had been.<br>I fled to her that day because I knew she would be straight with me.<br>I knew Grandma always told the truth, and I knew that the truth always went down a whole lot easier when swallowed with one of her world-famous cinnamon buns.<br>Grandma was home, and the buns were still warm.<br>Between bites, I told her everything.<br>She was ready for me.<br>No Santa Claus!' she snorted. '<br>Ridiculous!<br>Don't believe it.<br>That rumor has been going around for years, and it makes me mad, plain mad.<br>Now, put on your coat, and let's go.'<br>Go?<br>Go where, Grandma?' I asked.<br>I hadn't even finished my second cinnamon bun.<br>Where' turned out to be Kerby's General Store, the one store in town that had a little bit of just about everything.<br>As we walked through its doors, Grandma handed me ten dollars.<br>That was a bundle in those days.<br>Take this money,' she said, 'and buy something for someone who needs it.<br>I'll wait for you in the car.' Then she turned and walked out of Kerby's.<br>I was only eight years old.<br>I'd often gone shopping with my mother, but never had I shopped for anything all by myself.<br>The store seemed big and crowded, full of people scrambling to finish their Christmas shopping.<br>For a few moments I just stood there, confused, clutching that ten-dollar bill, wondering what to buy, and who on earth to buy it for.<br>I thought of everybody I knew: my family, my friends, my neighbors, the kids at school, the people who went to my church.<br>I was just about thought out, when I suddenly thought of Bobbie Decker.<br>Find more lyrics at <a href="http://mojim.com">※ Mojim.com</a><br>He was a kid with bad breath and messy hair, and he sat right behind me in Mrs.<br>Pollock's grade-two class.<br>Bobbie Decker didn't have a coat.<br>I knew that because he never went out for recess during the winter.<br>His mother always wrote a note, telling the teacher that he had a cough; but all we kids knew that Bobbie Decker didn't have a cough, and he didn't have a coat.<br>I fingered the ten-dollar bill with growing excitement.<br>I would buy Bobbie Decker a coat.<br>I settled on a red corduroy one that had a hood to it.<br>It looked real warm, and he would like that.<br>I didn't see a price tag, but ten dollars ought to buy anything.<br>I put the coat and my ten-dollar bill on the counter and pushed them toward the lady behind it.<br>She looked at the coat, the money, and me. '<br>Is this a Christmas present for someone?' she asked kindly. '<br>Yes,' I replied shyly. '<br>It's ...<br>for Bobbie.<br>He's in my class, and he doesn't have a coat.' The nice lady smiled at me.<br>I didn't get any change, but she put the coat in a bag and wished me a Merry Christmas.<br>That evening, Grandma helped me wrap the coat in Christmas paper and ribbons, and write, '<br>To Bobbie, From Santa Claus' on it ...<br>Grandma said that Santa always insisted on secrecy.<br>Then she drove me over to Bobbie Decker's house, explaining as we went that I was now and forever officially one of Santa's helpers.<br>Grandma parked down the street from Bobbie's house, and she and I crept noiselessly and hid in the bushes by his front walk.<br>Suddenly, Grandma gave me a nudge. '<br>All right, Santa Claus,' she whispered, 'get going.'<br>I took a deep breath, dashed for his front door, threw the present down on his step, pounded his doorbell twice and flew back to the safety of the bushes and Grandma.<br>Together we waited breathlessly in the darkness for the front door to open.<br>Finally it did, and there stood Bobbie.<br>He looked down, looked around, picked up his present, took it inside and closed the door.<br>Forty years haven't dimmed the thrill of those moments spent shivering, beside my grandma, in Bobbie Decker's bushes.<br>That night, I realized that those awful rumors about Santa Claus were just what Grandma said they were: Ridiculous!<br>Santa was alive and well ...<br>AND WE WERE ON HIS TEAM!<br><br>
