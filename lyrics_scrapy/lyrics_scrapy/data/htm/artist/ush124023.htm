<dd class="hb0">The Jolly Boys are a mento band from Port Antonio, Jamaica. It was formed in 1945 and had great commercial success in the late 1980s and 1990s among reggae and world music fans. They released a new album in 2010 (Great Expectation) and are currently the house band at GeeJam, a hotel in Port Antonio.<br><br>Current Lineup<br><br>Although its core group has remained fairly stable over the past sixty years, a full list of the Jolly Boys members would include a large number of official but transient members. Today, the 'original' group consists of Albert Minott (lead vocals), Derrick 'Johnny' Henry (rumba box), Allan Swymmer (percussion), and Egbert Watson (banjo). The current touring band mixes three of the original members (Minott, Bennett and Henry) with three younger members (Dale Dizzle Virgo on drums &amp; percussions; Lenford 'Brutus' Richards on banjo; and Harold Dawkins 'Jah T' on guitar). Long time member Joseph 'Powda' Bennett died on 20 August 2014 after a respiratory illness, aged 76. Albert Minott, lead singer of the band from 2009, died on 30 June 2017. He passed peacefully sitting on his veranda in Port Antonio. Minott, who was born on 14 September 1938, was 78 years old. He had suffered from respiratory problems for some time.<br><br>Discography<br><br>    1977 Roots of Reggae: Music From Jamaica (Lyrichord)<br>    1979 Jolly Boys at Club Caribbean (Club Caribbean)<br>    1989 Pop 'n' Mento (Rykodisc)<br>    1990 Quake with fear,The Jolly Boys are here (6 cd box set of previously unreleased material,including live recordings from their 1990 WOMAD festival appearance in Reading.(JB)<br>    1991 Sunshine N' Water (Rykodisc)<br>    1991 Beer Joint &amp; Tailoring (First Warning Records)<br>    1997 Live in Tokyo (Respect Records)<br>    2010 Great Expectation UK Release (Geejam Recordings/Wall of Sound/PIAS)<br>    2011 Great Expectation US Edition (Geejam Recordings/EOne)<br>    2014 Classic Mento from Port Antonio (forthcoming)</dd>
