<dd class="hb0">Raging Speedhorn are a British heavy metal band, founded in Corby, Northamptonshire.<br><br>Raging Speedhorn were formed in 1998 from the merging of the bands Soulcellar and Box. The band quickly established itself as a major presence within the UK's metal scene.<br><br>Raging Speedhorn featured two vocalists, a style largely inspired by the UK hardcore band Hard to Swallow, (which featured Bloody Kev who would join Raging Speedhorn as their second vocalist after the departure of Frank Regan in 2005). The band's first single, 'Thumper' (produced by industrial veteran, Marc Heal) was released in 2000 to significant critical acclaim.[citation needed] In 2001 they charted in the UK Singles Chart with 'The Gush'.<br><br>On early Raging Speedhorn recordings the music can be characterised by pounding basslines, heavily distorted riff-thick guitarwork and subject content consisting generally (but certainly not exclusively) of hedonism, drug-use, violence, antipathy for major band labels and depression.<br><br>Before The Sea Was Built was the only album the band produced with Larry Hibbitt, of Hundred Reasons. It was released on 11 September 2007 through Steamhammer, a subsidiary of SPV Records.<br><br>On 25 March 2008, it was announced the band would split after a final tour.[citation needed] Members joined other bands elsewhere, including Cardiff, Wales and Stockholm, Sweden.<br><br>John Loughlin, Jay Thompson and Dave Thompson were in metal band, The Death Of Us as of 2013.<br><br>On 18 February 2014 it was announced that the band would reform to perform at Damnation Festival in November 2014. Both John Loughlin and Frank Regan would feature on vocals, with the band showcasing tracks from their debut and sophomore albums. The band have also been confirmed to play the UK leg of the 2014 Sonisphere festival.<br><br>On 3 July 2014, the band played a sold-out hometown show with support from The Darkhorse and Heart of a Coward as a warm-up prior to playing at Sonisphere two days later. On 7 July 2014, an eleven-date UK tour was announced.<br><br>In January, 2016 the band recorded their new full-length record, Lost Ritual, with Russ Russell at the Parlour Studios, Kettering.<br><br>Albums<br><br>    Raging Speedhorn (2000)<br>    We Will Be Dead Tomorrow (2002)<br>    Live and Demos (2004)<br>    How the Great Have Fallen (2005)<br>    Before the Sea Was Built (2007)<br>    Lost Ritual (2016) </dd>
