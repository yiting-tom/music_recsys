<font style="color:#009933;font-size:16pt;"><b>Album Intro：</b></font>
<br>
<br>
'. . . A warm, crisp gem of an album . . . it features harmonies by Emmylou Harris, Nanci Griffith and Bonnie Bramlett and a band of stellar players such as Fats Kaplin, Robin Batteau and Mike Henderson. . . . Rush has a reputation as a great song-finder. . . . On his new album, Rush includes fine songs by Richard Dean, Steve Bruton, Melanie Dyer and Kim Beard Day among others, but the friskiest and most quietly plaintive songs come from Rush's own pen.' -- Daniel Gewertz, Boston Herald, January 26, 2009<br><br>'. . . a deceptively informal, warm and engaging collection of acoustic songs from a variety of sources, Rush's steady pulse at the center of every one. His solo acoustic `Drift Away,' which ends the set, is a stunning surprise.' -- Joel Selvin, San Francisco Chronicle<br><br>'His latest [CD] reaffirms his wit and genial presence in songs that highlight elegant, simple craftsmanship . . . Rush spins engaging yarns as second nature, folksy yet fun . . .' -- Thomas Kintner, Hartford Courant<br><br>'His vocal style remains the same -- good-natured, friendly, and intimate, with a tinge of weary wistfulness. Thankfully, the production, like Rush himself, is low-key and, though grounded in folk and country music, has full and varied instrumentation. While there are celebrity cameos in the shape of guest harmony vocals by Emmylou Harris, Nanci Griffith, and Bonnie Bramlett on a track apiece, those are sympathetic complementary contributions, not parts roped in to grab attention.' -- Richie Unterberger, AllMusic.com<br><br>'Legendary at finding just the right songs to capture a time (he is, after all, noted for recording songs by then unknowns such as Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, and Jackson Browne as well as Guy Clark and Bruce Cockburn) Rush unveils five originals, including the high steppin' `Hot Tonight' and the sly `One Good Man' and puts them alongside Eliza Gilkyson's seductive `Fall into the Night' and Steve Bruton's poignant `Too Many Memories,' which features a duet with Emmylou Harris. Melanie Dyer &amp; Kim Beard Day's melancholic, yet somewhat humorous `What An Old Lover Knows' just wouldn't sound the same if sung by anyone else. Rush . . . sticks to the tried and true, to country-folk-singer/songwriter mode, but that's really not the point. The point is an old friend returns, scarred but not broken, in good humor and grand voice.' -- Mike Jurkovich, Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange<br><br>'Rush is less about expounding universal truths than celebrating the individual moments that make life worth living . . . His lyrics are comfortably conversational, much like his lived in tenor, both of which are applied masterfully.' -- Randy Lewis, Los Angeles Times<br><br>'Rush still has that deep, relaxed voice that gives listeners the impression they're old friends listening in on a musical conversation. (4 stars).' -- Mike Regenstreif, Montreal Gazette<br><br>'With his typical low-key approach, Rush has made a wonderful new album, featuring a number of fine new Rush originals, as well as songs penned by the likes of Jack Tempchin, Stephen Bruton, Eliza Gilkyson and Bill Miller. And he caps off the album with a beautiful, understated rendition of the old Dobie Grey hit, `Drift Away,' accompanied only by his acoustic guitar and a cello.' -- Greg Haymes, Albany Times Union, January 29, 2009
